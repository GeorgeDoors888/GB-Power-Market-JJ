UPDATE EXISTING CONSTRAINT MAP IN YOUR SPREADSHEET
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Your spreadsheet already has an Apps Script with old map code.
         We need to REPLACE that code with the new working version.

SOLUTION:
1. Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12jY0d4jzD6lXFOVoqZZNjPRN-hJE3VmWFAPcC_kPKF8

2. Go to: Extensions → Apps Script

3. You'll see existing files. Find the one that has the constraint map code

4. REPLACE the entire contents with the code from:
   /Users/georgemajor/GB Power Market JJ/constraint_map_simple.gs

5. Save (Cmd+S)

6. Close Apps Script editor

7. Go back to spreadsheet

8. Click: Constraint Map → Interactive map refresh (or close/reopen sheet)

9. Then click: Constraint Map → Show Live Map (or similar menu item)

OPENING THE FILE NOW...
