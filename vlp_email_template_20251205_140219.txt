Dear [Aggregator] Commercial Team,

I am enquiring about Virtual Lead Party (VLP) aggregation services for a 
50 MWh / 25 MW battery storage system (2-hour duration, 90% round-trip efficiency).

Battery Specification:
• Capacity: 50 MWh
• Power: 25 MW
• Duration: 2 hours
• Efficiency: 90% round-trip
• Location: [TBD - UK grid connection]
• Expected COD: Q2 2026

Services Required:
1. Balancing Mechanism (BM) bidding and optimization
2. BSC settlement management
3. Real-time dispatch optimization
4. Optional: Frequency Response (FR) service stacking
5. Optional: Capacity Market (CM) participation support

Information Requested:
1. Revenue share structure (% of gross BM revenue)
2. Contract terms (length, exclusivity, termination clauses)
3. Minimum performance guarantees (if any)
4. Case studies of similar 20-30 MW batteries in your portfolio
5. Expected revenue benchmark (£/MWh or £/month)
6. Technical requirements (metering, communications, control systems)
7. Time to market (weeks from contract signing to first dispatch)
8. Settlement and reporting frequency

Our Analysis:
• Internal modeling suggests gross BM revenue of £113k/month for 25 MW battery
• Arbitrage baseline: £122k/month (proven from historical data)
• We are evaluating VLP route vs. direct BSC accreditation (£100k+ setup cost)

We are available for a call to discuss technical integration, contract terms, 
and expected revenue performance.

Best regards,
