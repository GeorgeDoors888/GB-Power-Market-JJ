# Copilot Model Picker (VS Code)

**Where to change the model:** In the **Copilot Chat input**, use the model picker dropdown.

**Cost tips**
- GitHub meters some models as premium requests. Prefer included models (e.g., GPT‑4.1 on paid plans) for routine work.
- The coding agent on GitHub.com also uses Actions minutes (Agent Mode inside VS Code does not).

**Best practice**
- Choose included models for most prompts; switch to heavier models only when needed.
