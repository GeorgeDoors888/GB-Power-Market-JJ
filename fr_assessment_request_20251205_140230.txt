            Only consider if stacked with other services

SECTION 4: STACKING & OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

Recommended Service Stack (Priority Order):

1. DYNAMIC CONTAINMENT (DC) - Primary Service
   Revenue: £51,000/month
   Availability: 16-20 hours/day
   SoC Management: 40-60% range
   
2. ENERGY ARBITRAGE - Secondary Service
   Revenue: £122,000/month (proven from historical data)
   Availability: During non-DC periods (4-8 hours/day)
   Strategy: Charge cheap (overnight), discharge expensive (peak)

SECTION 6: VLP AGGREGATOR FOR FR (OPTIONAL)
================================================================================

Using VLP Aggregator for FR Services:

Advantages:
  ✓ Aggregator handles ESO contracts and compliance
  ✓ Optimized stacking (DC + arbitrage + BM)
  ✓ Automated bidding and dispatch
  ✓ Faster time to market (4-6 weeks vs 12+ weeks direct)
  ✓ Lower technical burden (aggregator manages metering/comms)

Disadvantages:
  ✗ Revenue share (10-20% to aggregator)
  ✗ Less control over dispatch decisions
  ✗ Contract lock-in (12-24 months typical)

Recommended Aggregators for FR:
  1. Flexitricity - Strong FR track record, excellent stacking
  2. Habitat Energy - AI-driven optimization, highest revenue/MWh
  3. Open Energi - DC market pioneer, fast deployment
  4. Limejump - Market leader, comprehensive services

Direct ESO Route:
  Advantages: Keep 100% revenue, full control
  Disadvantages: 12+ weeks setup, technical complexity, ongoing compliance burden
  Recommendation: Only for portfolios >50 MW or if in-house expertise available

SECTION 7: BATTERY DEGRADATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Frequency Response Impact on Battery Life:

DC Service Degradation:
  Typical Cycling: 0.5-1.5 cycles/day (lower than arbitrage)
  Depth of Discharge: 20-40% (shallow cycles)
  Calendar Life Impact: Minimal (<5% additional degradation)
  Warranty Coverage: Usually covered under standard warranty
  
Arbitrage Degradation:
  Typical Cycling: 2 cycles/day (design spec)
  Depth of Discharge: 80-90%
  Calendar Life Impact: As per manufacturer warranty
  
Combined DC + Arbitrage:
  Total Cycling: 2.5-3.5 cycles/day
  Degradation Rate: 2-3% per year (within acceptable range)
  Warranty Considerations: Check with manufacturer for stacked services
  Expected Battery Life: 12-15 years (20+ years calendar life typical)

Recommendation: DC stacking is low-risk from degradation perspective
                Benefits outweigh minimal additional wear

SECTION 8: FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
================================================================================

DC Service Revenue Scenarios:

Conservative (40% utilization, £12/MW/hour):
  25 MW x £12/MW/h x 24h x 30d x 40% = £86,400/month

Base Case (50% utilization, £17/MW/hour):
  25 MW x £17/MW/h x 24h x 30d x 50% = £153,000/month

Optimistic (60% utilization, £22/MW/hour):
  25 MW x £22/MW/h x 24h x 30d x 60% = £237,600/month

Used in Battery Revenue Model: £51,000/month
(Conservative assumption: 40% utilization, £17/MW/h average)

Net of VLP Fee (15%): £43,350/month
