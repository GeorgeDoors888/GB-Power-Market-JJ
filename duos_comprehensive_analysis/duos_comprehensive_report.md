   - National Grid (East Midlands) has the highest Red band rate
   - SSEN has higher Green band rates compared to other DNOs



## Recommendations

1. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Schedule high-consumption activities during Green band periods (overnight and weekends)
   - Minimize consumption during Red band periods (typically 16:00-19:00 on weekdays)
   - Consider load shifting or battery storage to avoid Red band costs

2. **Regional Considerations:**
   - UK Power Networks regions generally have more favorable rates
   - London has unique dual Red band periods that require special attention
   - Scottish regions have more extensive Amber band coverage on weekends
