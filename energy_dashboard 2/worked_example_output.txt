🔑 KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. Battery Value comes from AVOIDING RED LOSSES:
   - RED import cost: £190.79/MWh
   - PPA revenue: £150.0/MWh
   - Loss per MWh: £40.79
   - Annual RED demand: 2,275 MWh
   - Without battery loss: £92,797
   - Battery avoids: £0

2. Arbitrage Profit is SMALL:
   - Charge GREEN @ £128.26/MWh
   - Discharge for £150.0/MWh + £2.40 VLP
   - Gross margin: £24.14/MWh
   - After 15% losses: £20.52/MWh

3. Fixed Levies are EXPENSIVE:
   - Levies: £98.15/MWh (66% of total GREEN cost)
   - Paid on ALL imports (charging + direct)
   - Annual levy cost: £1,511,510

4. Current Market vs Historical:
   - 2023 GREEN: £30.00/MWh → Total £128.26 ✅ Profitable
   - 2025 GREEN: £65.83/MWh → Total £164.09 ❌ Unprofitable
   - System prices doubled, making BtM PPA unviable
