# NESO and Elexon Data Report

**Generated on:** August 22, 2025  
**Project:** jibber-jabber-knowledge

## Executive Summary

An extensive scan of the Google Cloud environment has identified several datasets containing NESO and Elexon data. This report summarizes the findings and highlights a critical issue: there appears to be a discrepancy between the documented historical data range (2016-2025) and the actual data available in the primary BigQuery tables (2023-2024).

### Key Findings

1. **Data Fragmentation:** NESO and Elexon data is scattered across multiple BigQuery datasets in the project.

2. **Date Range Inconsistency:** 
   - The documentation mentions historical data going back to 2016
   - The primary tables in `uk_energy_prod` only contain data from 2023-2024
   - Only limited 2016 data was found in a few tables in other datasets

3. **Data Source Distribution:**
   - 13 tables containing NESO data
   - 19 tables containing Elexon data
   - Multiple copies of the same data exist across different datasets

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Primary Production Dataset (uk_energy_prod)

This dataset contains the main tables used by the dashboards and analysis scripts:

| Table | Data Type | Row Count | Date Range |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| neso_demand_forecasts | NESO | 35,088 | 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| neso_wind_forecasts | NESO | 175,440 | 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| neso_balancing_services | NESO | 35,088 | 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| neso_carbon_intensity | NESO | 35,088 | 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| neso_interconnector_flows | NESO | 210,528 | 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31 |
| elexon_system_warnings | Elexon | 56 | 2023-01-10 to 2024-12-25 |
| elexon_demand_outturn | Elexon | 0 | No data |
| elexon_generation_outturn | Elexon | 0 | No data |

### 2. Tables with 2016 Data

The only tables containing data from 2016 are:

| Dataset | Table | Row Count | Date Range |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| uk_energy_data | elexon_fuel_generation | 4,992 | 2016-01-01 to 2016-01-08 |
| uk_energy_data_gemini_eu | elexon_fuel_generation | 4,992 | 2016-01-01 to 2016-01-08 |
| us_central1_gemini_models | elexon_fuel_generation | 4,992 | 2016-01-01 to 2016-01-08 |

**Note:** These appear to be copies of the same data, covering only the first week of 2016.

### 3. Other Relevant Datasets

Several other datasets contain NESO and Elexon data:

- **uk_energy:** Contains empty tables for several Elexon and NESO data types
- **uk_energy_data:** Contains some Elexon data with limited date ranges
- **uk_energy_analysis:** Contains analysis results from processing the main dataset

### 4. Google Cloud Storage Buckets

Several GCS buckets contain NESO and Elexon related files:

- **elexon-historical-data-storage**
- **jibber-jabber-knowledge-bmrs-data**
- **jibber-jabber-knowledge-bmrs-data-eu**

## Analysis of the Issue

### Documentation vs. Reality

The project documentation (SETUP_GUIDE.md and comprehensive_uk_energy_bigquery_report.md) refers to data collection capabilities from 2016 onward, but the actual BigQuery tables used for analysis contain only 2023-2024 data.

### Possible Explanations

1. **Incomplete Data Loading:** Historical data may exist in source files but hasn't been loaded into BigQuery
2. **Documentation Error:** Documentation may be describing planned capabilities rather than actual implemented state
3. **Data Migration Issue:** Data may have been lost during migration between environments

## Recommendations

1. **Data Audit:** 
   - Verify what historical data actually exists in Cloud Storage buckets
   - Confirm which data sources are reliable and authoritative

2. **Data Consolidation:**
   - Identify the primary dataset that should be used for analysis
   - Consolidate duplicate data and remove redundant copies

3. **Historical Data Recovery:**
   - If 2016-2022 data is needed, investigate if it can be recovered from source files
   - Use existing data collection scripts to fill the gaps

4. **Documentation Update:**
   - Update documentation to accurately reflect the actual data availability
   - Clarify which datasets are production vs. development/test

## Next Steps

1. Investigate the source files in Cloud Storage to determine if older historical data exists
2. Update the data generation scripts to fill in the missing historical periods if needed
3. Consolidate all analysis on the confirmed primary dataset
4. Update documentation to reflect the actual state of the data
