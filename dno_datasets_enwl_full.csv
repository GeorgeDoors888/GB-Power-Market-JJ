<p>
Specifically formatted to align with SP ENW DFES data, this Polygon dataset is still created using Voronoi methodology (described below), but includes the polygonal representation of the sites joined together or split through busbars as defined in SP ENW's DFES submission. 
</p>

<p>
Individual Polygons are created using the Voronoi methodology, each one containing a single distribution substation, these individual polygons are first grouped together (based on common attribution) then merged, to create a new series of interlocking polygons forming a high-level representation of Primary Substation feeding areas. 
</p>

<p>
The larger polygons representing the feeding areas of Bulk Supply Points (BSP's) are generated by grouping, then merging, the Primary polygons in the same manner (a similar process creates GSP polygons from the BSP Voronoi).
</p>

<p>
Document explaining the Voronoi process and creation of the feeding area polygons is available to download from the 'Alternative Exports' section of the Export tab (above)

This dataset depicts the Primary Substation sites featured in the 'SP - DFES - Primary Data' dataset. This will allow you to spatially map the DFES 2024 data using the 'Group Number' attribute (common to both datasets)
</p>

<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report. It contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
 </p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

<b>SP ENW - DFES - LV Headroom (Monitored) Data - New 2024 Dataset</b>
</p>

<p>SP ENW is currently using PreSense units to monitor the power of secondary substations, particularly those with a large number of customers. The data is processed in real-time and aggregated into half-hourly intervals. In its RIIO-ED2 Business Plan, SP ENW outlined its plans to achieve 95% network visibility coverage during the price control period using distribution monitoring equipment (PreSense),  with the remaining 5% covered by smart meters. As of March 2025, 60% of customers are covered by PreSense.
The substations being monitored have been identified because they have been monitored for over a year, providing sufficient data points throughout the period, especially during winter. This real-time monitoring data is used to identify the maximum demand of secondary substations. There is an ongoing programme to identify new sites for monitoring to expand coverage and improve network visibility.
</p>
<p>
This dataset contains the headroom (kVA) forecast for PreSense-monitored secondary substations, based on the maximum demand forecast and substation transformer ratings.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report, it contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

<b>SP ENW - DFES - LV Headroom (Unmonitored) Data - New 2024 Dataset</b>
</p>

<p>SP ENW is currently using PreSense units to monitor the power of secondary substations, particularly those with a large number of customers. The data is processed in real-time and aggregated into half-hourly intervals. In its RIIO-ED2 Business Plan, SP ENW outlined its plans to achieve 95% network visibility coverage during the price control period using distribution monitoring equipment (PreSense),  with the remaining 5% covered by smart meters. As of March 2025, 60% of customers are covered by PreSense.
The substations being monitored have been identified because they have been monitored for over a year, providing sufficient data points throughout the period, especially during winter. This real-time monitoring data is used to identify the maximum demand of secondary substations. There is an ongoing programme to identify new sites for monitoring to expand coverage and improve network visibility.
</p>
<p>
This table contains the headroom (kVA) forecast for unmonitored secondary substations, based on the maximum demand forecast and substation transformer ratings.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report, it contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

Specifically formatted to align with SP ENW DFES data, this Polygon dataset is still created using Voronoi methodology (described below), but includes the polygonal representation of the sites joined together or split through busbars as defined in SP ENW's DFES submission. 
</p>

<p>
Individual Polygons are created using the Voronoi methodology, each one containing a single distribution substation, these individual polygons are first grouped together (based on common attribution) then merged, to create a new series of interlocking polygons forming a high-level representation of Primary Substation feeding areas. 
</p>

<p>
The larger polygons representing the feeding areas of Bulk Supply Points (BSP's) are generated by grouping, then merging, the Primary polygons in the same manner (a similar process creates GSP polygons from the BSP Voronoi).
</p>

<p>
Document explaining the Voronoi process and creation of the feeding area polygons is available to download from the 'Alternative Exports' section of the Export tab (above)

The Entire Network Data section within our Distributed Future Electricity Scenarios (DFES) content, details our view of the North West’s future electricity requirements and represents forecasts based on the entire network within our operational boundary.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report. It contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
 </p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

The Bulk Supply Point (BSP) Data section within our Distributed Future Electricity Scenarios (DFES) content, details our view of the North West’s future electricity requirements and represents forecasts based on the BSPs within our operational boundary.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report. It contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
</p>
<p>
The spatial point features within this dataset do not represent substation locations, instead they are the centroid location of the accompanying 'DFES - BSP Polygons' dataset
</p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

The combination of values have been concatenated into each of the 20 building archetypes, for example
</p>
<p>
F-ELECTRIC | L-URBAN | S-LARGE | T-OTHER | A-RECENT | (kWh)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Individual Polygons are created using the Voronoi methodology, each one containing a single distribution substation, these individual polygons are first grouped together (based on common attribution) then merged, to create a new series of interlocking polygons forming a high-level representation of Primary Substation feeding areas. 
</p>

<p>
The larger polygons representing the feeding areas of Bulk Supply Points (BSP's) are generated by grouping, then merging, the Primary polygons in the same manner (a similar process creates GSP polygons from the BSP Voronoi).

Document explaining the Voronoi process and creation of the feeding area polygons is available to download from the 'Alternative Exports' section of the Export tab (above)
