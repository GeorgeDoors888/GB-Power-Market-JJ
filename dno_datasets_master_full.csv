<p>
Specifically formatted to align with SP ENW DFES data, this Polygon dataset is still created using Voronoi methodology (described below), but includes the polygonal representation of the sites joined together or split through busbars as defined in SP ENW's DFES submission. 
</p>

<p>
Individual Polygons are created using the Voronoi methodology, each one containing a single distribution substation, these individual polygons are first grouped together (based on common attribution) then merged, to create a new series of interlocking polygons forming a high-level representation of Primary Substation feeding areas. 
</p>

<p>
The larger polygons representing the feeding areas of Bulk Supply Points (BSP's) are generated by grouping, then merging, the Primary polygons in the same manner (a similar process creates GSP polygons from the BSP Voronoi).
</p>

<p>
Document explaining the Voronoi process and creation of the feeding area polygons is available to download from the 'Alternative Exports' section of the Export tab (above)

This dataset depicts the Primary Substation sites featured in the 'SP - DFES - Primary Data' dataset. This will allow you to spatially map the DFES 2024 data using the 'Group Number' attribute (common to both datasets)
</p>

<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report. It contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
 </p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

<b>SP ENW - DFES - LV Headroom (Monitored) Data - New 2024 Dataset</b>
</p>

<p>SP ENW is currently using PreSense units to monitor the power of secondary substations, particularly those with a large number of customers. The data is processed in real-time and aggregated into half-hourly intervals. In its RIIO-ED2 Business Plan, SP ENW outlined its plans to achieve 95% network visibility coverage during the price control period using distribution monitoring equipment (PreSense),  with the remaining 5% covered by smart meters. As of March 2025, 60% of customers are covered by PreSense.
The substations being monitored have been identified because they have been monitored for over a year, providing sufficient data points throughout the period, especially during winter. This real-time monitoring data is used to identify the maximum demand of secondary substations. There is an ongoing programme to identify new sites for monitoring to expand coverage and improve network visibility.
</p>
<p>
This dataset contains the headroom (kVA) forecast for PreSense-monitored secondary substations, based on the maximum demand forecast and substation transformer ratings.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report, it contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

<b>SP ENW - DFES - LV Headroom (Unmonitored) Data - New 2024 Dataset</b>
</p>

<p>SP ENW is currently using PreSense units to monitor the power of secondary substations, particularly those with a large number of customers. The data is processed in real-time and aggregated into half-hourly intervals. In its RIIO-ED2 Business Plan, SP ENW outlined its plans to achieve 95% network visibility coverage during the price control period using distribution monitoring equipment (PreSense),  with the remaining 5% covered by smart meters. As of March 2025, 60% of customers are covered by PreSense.
The substations being monitored have been identified because they have been monitored for over a year, providing sufficient data points throughout the period, especially during winter. This real-time monitoring data is used to identify the maximum demand of secondary substations. There is an ongoing programme to identify new sites for monitoring to expand coverage and improve network visibility.
</p>
<p>
This table contains the headroom (kVA) forecast for unmonitored secondary substations, based on the maximum demand forecast and substation transformer ratings.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report, it contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
</p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

Specifically formatted to align with SP ENW DFES data, this Polygon dataset is still created using Voronoi methodology (described below), but includes the polygonal representation of the sites joined together or split through busbars as defined in SP ENW's DFES submission. 
</p>

<p>
Individual Polygons are created using the Voronoi methodology, each one containing a single distribution substation, these individual polygons are first grouped together (based on common attribution) then merged, to create a new series of interlocking polygons forming a high-level representation of Primary Substation feeding areas. 
</p>

<p>
The larger polygons representing the feeding areas of Bulk Supply Points (BSP's) are generated by grouping, then merging, the Primary polygons in the same manner (a similar process creates GSP polygons from the BSP Voronoi).
</p>

<p>
Document explaining the Voronoi process and creation of the feeding area polygons is available to download from the 'Alternative Exports' section of the Export tab (above)

The Entire Network Data section within our Distributed Future Electricity Scenarios (DFES) content, details our view of the North West’s future electricity requirements and represents forecasts based on the entire network within our operational boundary.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report. It contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
 </p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

The Bulk Supply Point (BSP) Data section within our Distributed Future Electricity Scenarios (DFES) content, details our view of the North West’s future electricity requirements and represents forecasts based on the BSPs within our operational boundary.
</p>
<p>
The collection of DFES datasets envisages a range of possible views of the future, which indicate how different influences can change electrical demand and generation on our network. 
</p>
<p>
This dataset is an accompaniment to our 2024 DFES report. It contains detailed datasets and interactive tools which allow our customers to understand what our Distribution Future Electricity Scenarios mean to them.
</p>
<p>
The spatial point features within this dataset do not represent substation locations, instead they are the centroid location of the accompanying 'DFES - BSP Polygons' dataset
</p>
<p>
Please refer to our main DFES report for a full description of our forecasts and scenarios. Our forecasts are not precise predictions of what the future is likely to be, but instead frame the uncertainty within our planning as explained in the main report.

The combination of values have been concatenated into each of the 20 building archetypes, for example
</p>
<p>
F-ELECTRIC | L-URBAN | S-LARGE | T-OTHER | A-RECENT | (kWh)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Individual Polygons are created using the Voronoi methodology, each one containing a single distribution substation, these individual polygons are first grouped together (based on common attribution) then merged, to create a new series of interlocking polygons forming a high-level representation of Primary Substation feeding areas. 
</p>

<p>
The larger polygons representing the feeding areas of Bulk Supply Points (BSP's) are generated by grouping, then merging, the Primary polygons in the same manner (a similar process creates GSP polygons from the BSP Voronoi).

Document explaining the Voronoi process and creation of the feeding area polygons is available to download from the 'Alternative Exports' section of the Export tab (above)

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-grid-postcode-area,UK Power Networks Grid Substation Distribution Areas,"<h2>Introduction</h2><p>This dataset is a geospatial view of the areas fed by grid substations. The aim is to create an indicative map showing the extent to which individual grid substations feed areas based on MPAN data.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ul>
        
<li>Data Extraction and Cleaning: MPAN data is queried from SQL Server and saved as a CSV. Invalid values and incorrectly formatted postcodes are removed using a Test Filter in FME.</li>
        
<li>Data Filtering and Assignment: MPAN data is categorized into EPN, LPN, and SPN based on the first two digits. Postcodes are assigned a Primary based on the highest number of MPANs fed from different Primary Sites.</li>
        
<li>Polygon Creation and Cleaning: Primary Feed Polygons are created and cleaned to remove holes and inclusions. Donut Polygons (holes) are identified, assigned to the nearest Primary, and merged.</li>
        
<li>Grid Supply Point Integration: Primaries are merged into larger polygons based on Grid Site relationships. ny Primaries not fed from a Grid Site are marked as NULL and labeled.</li>

        <li>Functional Location Codes (FLOC) Matching: FLOC codes are extracted and matched to Primaries, Grid Sites and Grid Supply Points. Confirmed FLOCs are used to ensure accuracy, with any unmatched sites reviewed by the Open Data Team.</li>
</ul>  


<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>
Quality Control Measures include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Verification steps to match features only with confirmed functional locations. </li>
<li>Manual review and correct of data inconsistencies</li>
<li>Use of additional verification steps to ensure accuracy in the methodology</li>
<li>Regular updates and reviews documented in the version history</li>

<h2 class="""">Methodological approach</h2>
<p>The dataset is generalised using our GIS customer
connectivity model. Each Secondary Substation's connected LV Network is traced out to its electrical extents, including all connected customers. Using the geographic position of customer connections and key network points of both the Substation being traced and surrounding Substation's network, a Voronoi diagram is created. Each Voronoi polygon that intersects with the traced network is joined together to produce a single polygon, depicting the Supply Zone.</p>

In simple terms, the energy entering our network is higher than the energy received by our customers and this is what we call a 'loss'. Losses can occur in a number of ways, please refer to our <a href=""https://losses.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">losses site</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Methodological Approach</h2><p class="""">Network losses in this dataset are
calculated as the difference between units of electricity entering the network and units exiting the network. Due to delays in the data required to calculate the losses, final losses are not determined until 14 months after the date, referred to in this dataset as 'RF', albeit these can still change for up to 6 years due to corrections to IDNO and half-hourly customers' data.</p><p>Delayed data includes the consumption of domestic customers and generation of small generators due to infrequent meter readings. Initial estimates are made (for example, estimated domestic bills), and it takes 5 reconciliations over a 14 month period to approach an accurate figure for units exiting the network. <b>Our reporting is often required at the start of this reconciliation cycle, so the most up to date data available at that time is used but this will become outdated as further reconciliations come in</b>.</p><p></p><p><b>In addition to the reconciliations, the values used for our reporting are displayed in columns labelled 'Regulatory Reporting'.</b> In some areas the reported values are not an exact match for any previous iteration of the data. This is due to metering errors of half hourly metered customers which are later corrected by the customer. <br></p><p class="""">
Consumption data is sourced from Elexon, the company that manage the Balancing and Settlement Code. The main purpose of this data is to provide the data for billing DUoS, hence it is not necessarily complete for unbilled consumption or generation.

over 8,000 electric vehicles (EVs) driven for commercial purposes through three trials. The project also implemented a range of technical and commercial solutions aiming to accelerate the transition to EVs for commercial fleet operators, while helping GB’s distribution networks plan and prepare for the mass adoption of EVs. The project aimed to reduce the impact of EVs on
distribution networks and ensure security of electricity supply while saving money for electricity customers, helping the UK meet its clean air and climate change objectives.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,project-enable,Project Enable - Projections for Blue Badge Holders and Parking Bays,"<h2>Introduction</h2><p>As part of our Enable project, we estimated the projected number of on-street disabled parking bays and Blue Badge holders in our licence areas by 2030. This data is available at the Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA) level. We hope that this data will help local authorities and charge point operators plan for accessible transport provision for customers.</p><p>This project started in March 2021 and concluded in March 2022.</p>

<p>
More information on what we're doing for accessible transport can be found at <a href=""https://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/electricity/Accessible-transport-information-hub"">UK Power Networks Accessible transport information hub</a> and <a href=""https://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/projects/enable/"">project-enable</a>.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-shlaa,Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA),"<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA) is a technical exercise to determine the quantity and suitability of land potentially available for housing development. It is not a site allocations exercise – the purpose is to provide a robust indication of aggregate housing capacity at local authority level.</p>

    <p>Please note this dataset is restricted, and if you would like to be considered for access, please contact: ""opendata@ukpowernetworks.co.uk""</p>

    <p>This dataset is a collation of SHLAAs that UK Power Networks has access to, and is primarily for use in conjunction with the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-noise-contours/"">Noise Propagation</a> dataset.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>This dataset was compiled using different SHLAA files that UK Power Networks owned and received from local authorities.</p>


<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>
Quality Control Measures include:
</p><li>Verification steps to match features only with confirmed functional locations. </li>
<li>Manual review and correct of data inconsistencies</li>
<li>Use of additional verification steps to ensure accuracy in the methodology</li>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-noise-contours,Areas Affected by Noise from Grid or Primary Sites,"<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>These maps show the potential area affected by noise from Grid or Primary Substations.  Acoustic mitigation strategies that have already been applied to some substations are not reflected in the maps.Please take this into account when looking at individual sites.</p>

<p>Please note this dataset is restricted, and if you would like to be considered for access, please contact: ""opendata @ukpowernetworks.co.uk""</p>

<p>Developers and local authority planners should be aware that the responsibility to mitigate noise issues rests with the developer as the ‘agent of change’.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>There are three contours:<br></p><table class=""table table-bordered""><tbody><tr><td><h4 class="""">Distance (m)</h4></td><td><h4>Predicted Noise Level (dBA)</h4></td><td><h4>Complaints</h4></td><td><h4 class="""">Action</h4></td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>44</td><td>Likely from any new residential development</td><td>Please consult environment@ukpowernetworks.co.uk</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>39</td><td>Possible from any new residential development</td><td>Please consult environment@ukpowernetworks.co.uk<br></td></tr><tr><td>135</td><td>34</td><td>Not very likely</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-flexibility-tender-data,Flexibility Tender Data by Postcode,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This dataset provides information on where UK Power Networks requires flexibility services. The dataset provides a mapping of postcodes to Flexibility Zones – for all existing and historic day-ahead and long-term flexibility requirements.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>This enables potential flexibility service providers to
quickly understand their eligibility for revenue from flexibility, without sharing any sensitive personal or commercial information. </p><p"">This dataset provides an approximation of eligibility for
our flexibility tenders. Please note that even if your asset is within a postcode listed in this dataset, as part of the flexibility procurement process we will need to validate that the individual meter point (MPAN) is electrically connected to the Flexibility Zone.<p></p>
<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>Postcodes are listed against a Flexibility Zone where at
least one meter point within that postcode is electrically connected to the constrained network asset. </p>
<p>For large Flexibility Zones, which cover multiple postcodes,
this will be a very good indication of eligibility for flexibility services. For smaller Flexibility Zones, particularly those at Low Voltage, a significant proportion of properties within a listed postcode may ultimately not be eligible.</p>
<p>As part of our flexibility procurement process, we will
check the individual meter point (MPAN) to confirm its final eligibility. This dataset offers an approximation of eligibility, without requiring any sharing of household or business level data. </p>
<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>Dispatches are passed through a quality control algorithm to
flag anomalies and erroneous data. Quality control checks include:</p>
<p></p><li>Checking the formatting of postcodes<p></p></li>
<p></p><li>Checking the number of postcodes mapped to each
Flexibility Zone</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>Checking that Flexibility Zone names align with
those in other datasets on the Open Data Portal and on UK Power Networks’ chosen flexibility market platform: <a href=""https://www.localflex.co.uk/home"" target=""_blank"">www.localflex.co.uk</a><a href=""http://www.localflex.com"" target=""_blank""></a></li><p></p>
<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>
<p>The Flex Zone to Postcode mapping is reviewed before
publication by a member of Flexibility Markets team.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-flexibility-dispatches,Flexibility Dispatches,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This dataset reports on UK Power Networks' use of paid flexibility services. UK Power Networks uses flexibility (demand/generation turn up/down) in London, the South East, and the East of England to manage electricity flows on the local electricity distribution network.</p>
<p>Flexibility dispatches data can be used to understand historical volumes, prices paid, geographic locations, providers, and technologies used. Using the Analyse tab, users can visualize and explore the growth of flexibility dispatches. These transparent insights can inform current and prospective flexibility services providers on how often flexibility is dispatched and at what price, including local authorities, electricity suppliers, industrial/commercial energy users, and generation operators. The data can also be used by wider stakeholders such as market analysts, advisers, regulators, and policymakers.</p>
<p>A wide variety of energy resources and low carbon technologies already provide flexibility services to UK Power Networks, including grid-scale batteries, electric vehicle charge points, solar farms, wind farms, and residential energy users. These are grouped using the industry standard technology categorizations as used for regulatory reporting. To find out more about how to participate in flexibility tenders and become a flexibility provider, visit our webpage: <a href=""https://dso.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/flexibility"">Flexibility - UKPN DSO (ukpowernetworks.co.uk)</a>.</p>
<p>Flexibility dispatches are currently reported from 1 April 2023, with new dispatches added monthly. Each row includes the timing, location, product, capacity, technology, and provider for our growing volume of flexibility dispatches. The data is assessed for errors using algorithmic quality control as well as being evaluated manually by a flexibility engineer before publication. The dataset can be downloaded or incorporated into the user’s interface via API.</p>
<p>Requested volumes may not match delivered volumes, depending on performance against the relevant baseline. You can find actual dispatch data in the yearly Procurement Statements and Reports at <a href=""https://dso.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/flexibility/tender-hub"">Tender Hub - UKPN DSO (ukpowernetworks.co.uk)</a>. This includes our annual Flexibility Statement (forecasts for the next regulatory year), Flexibility Report (outcomes from last regulatory year), and data appendices.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dispatches are made by a control engineer in the DSO Operations team to manage local constraints. Dispatches of flexible units (FUs) may be made either by API or email, depending on the FU's technological capabilities and preference.</li>
<li>This dataset reports on dispatches made under Secure, Dynamic, and Day-Ahead products. Flexibility provided through our Sustain product is not dispatched and hence is not included within this dataset.</li>
<li>Requested volumes may not match delivered volumes, depending on performance against the relevant baseline.
<p>Historic data may be updated from time to time where data errors are identified.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>Dispatches are passed through a quality control algorithm to flag anomalies and erroneous data. Quality control checks include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Times are consistent with the contracted service window;</li>
  <li>Dispatches are matched to the correct flexibility zone;</li>
  <li>Dispatches are unique (no duplicates);</li>
  <li>Dispatches are issued at the contracted price and volume;</li>
  <li>Dispatches are matched with an active contract.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>
<p>The flexibility dispatch report is reviewed by a flexibility engineer and a member of the Data Science team to ensure the data is accurate before publication on the Open Data Portal. Any data errors in previous reports are corrected on an ongoing basis and updated monthly.</p>

An important part of the distribution network is distributing this electricity across our regions through circuits. Electricity enters our network through Super Grid Transformers at substations shared with National Grid we call Grid Supply Points. It is then sent at across our 132 kV Circuits towards our grid substations and primary substations. From there, electricity is distributed along the 33 kV circuits to bring it closer to the home.  These circuits can be viewed on the single line diagrams in our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"" target=""_blank"">Long-Term Development Statements (LTDS)</a> and the underlying data is then found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/?disjunctive.theme&amp;disjunctive.dublin-core.subject&amp;sort=explore.popularity_score&amp;refine.dublin-core.subject=Long+Term+Development+Statements+(LTDS)"" target=""_blank"">LTDS tables</a>.<br></p>



<p>Care is taken to protect the private affairs of companies connected to the 33 kV network, resulting in the redaction of certain circuits.

Please visit our Network Operational Data Dashboard for more operational datasets.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2><p>The dataset is not derived, it is the measurements from our network stored in our historian. </p>
<p>The measurement devices are taken from current transformers attached to the cable at the circuit breaker, and power is derived combining this with the data from voltage transformers physically attached to the busbar. The historian stores datasets based on a report-by-exception process, such that a certain deviation from the present value must be reached before logging a point measurement to the historian. We extract the data following a 30-min time weighted averaging method to get half-hourly values. Where there are no measurements logged in the period, the data provided is blank; due to the report-by-exception process, it may be appropriate to forward fill this data for shorter gaps. </p>
<p>We developed a data redactions process to protect the privacy or companies according to the <a href=""https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/27/section/105"" target=""_blank"">Utilities Act 2000 section 105.1.b</a>, which requires UK Power Networks to not disclose information relating to the affairs of a business. For this reason, where the demand of a private customer is derivable from our data and that data is not already public information (e.g., data provided via Elexon on the Balancing Mechanism), we redact the half-hourly time series, and provide only the monthly averages. This redaction process considers the correlation of all the data, of only corresponding periods where the customer is active, the first order difference of all the data, and the first order difference of only corresponding periods where the customer is active. Should any of these four tests have a high linear correlation, the data is deemed redacted. This process is not simply applied to only the circuit of the customer, but of the surrounding circuits that would also reveal the signal of that customer. </p><p>The directionality of the data is not consistent within this dataset. Where directionality was ascertainable, we arrange the power data in the direction of the LTDS ""from node"" to the LTDS ""to node"". Measurements of current do not indicate directionality and are instead positive regardless of direction. In some circumstances, the polarity can be negative, and depends on the data commissioner's decision on what the operators in the control room might find most helpful in ensuring reliable and secure network operation. </p><h2>Quality Control Statement</h2><p>The data is provided ""as is"".  </p><p> In the design and delivery process adopted by the DSO, customer feedback and guidance is considered at each phase of the project. One of the earliest steers was that raw data was preferable. This means that we do not perform prior quality control screening to our raw network data. The result of this decision is that network rearrangements and other periods of non-intact running of the network are present throughout the dataset, which has the potential to misconstrue the true utilisation of the network, which is determined regulatorily by considering only by in-tact running arrangements. Therefore, taking the maximum or minimum of these measurements are not a reliable method of correctly ascertaining the true utilisation. This does have the intended added benefit of giving a realistic view of how the network was operated. The critical feedback was that our customers have a desire to understand what would have been the impact to them under real operational conditions. As such, this dataset offers unique insight into that. </p>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2><p>Creating this dataset involved a lot of human data imputation. At UK Power Networks, we have differing software to run the network operationally (ADMS) and to plan and study the network (PowerFactory). The measurement devices are intended to primarily inform the network operators of the real time condition of the network, and importantly, the network drawings visible in the LTDS are a planning approach, which differs to the operational. To compile this dataset, we made the union between the two modes of operating manually. A team of data scientists, data engineers, and power system engineers manually identified the LTDS circuit from the single line diagram, identified the line name from LTDS Table 2a/b, then identified the same circuit in ADMS to identify the measurement data tags. This was then manually inputted to a spreadsheet. Any influential customers to that circuit were noted using ADMS and the single line diagrams. From there, a python code is used to perform the triage and compilation of the datasets.  </p><p>There is potential for human error during the manual data processing. These issues can include missing circuits, incorrectly labelled circuits, incorrectly identified measurement data tags, incorrectly interpreted directionality. Whilst care has been taken to minimise the risk of these issues, they may persist in the provided dataset. Any uncertain behaviour observed by using this data should be reported to allow us to correct as fast as possible.</p><h2>Additional Information</h2><p>Definitions of key terms related to this dataset can be found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/glossary/"">Open Data Portal Glossary</a>.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-data-centre-demand-profiles,Data Centre Demand Profiles,"<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This dataset shows the half-hourly load profiles of identified data centres within UK Power Networks' licence areas.</p>

<p>The loads have been determined using actual demand data from connected sites within UK Power Networks' licence areas, from 1 January 2023 onwards.</p>

<p>Loads are expressed proportionally, by comparing the half-hourly observed import power seen across the site's meter point(s), against the meter's maximum import capacity. Units for both measures are apparent power, in kilovolt amperes (kVA).</p>

<p>To protect the identity of the sites, data points have been anonymised and only the site's voltage level information - and our estimation of the data centre type - has been provided.</p>


<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>


<p>Over 100 operational data centre sites (and at least 10 per voltage level) were identified through internal desktop exercises and corroboration with external sources.</p>


<p>After identifying these sites, their addresses, connection point, and MPAN(s) (Meter Point Administration Number(s)) were identified using internal systems.</p>


<p>Half-hourly smart meter import data were retrieved using internal systems. This included both half-hourly meter data, and static data (such as the MPAN's maximum import capacity and voltage group, the latter through the MPAN's Line Loss Factor Class Description). Half-hourly meter import data came in the form of active and reactive power, and the apparent power was calculated using the power triangle.
</p>


<p>In cases where there are numerous meter points for a given data centre site, the observed import powers across all relevant meter points were summed, and compared against the sum total of maximum import capacity for the meters.</p>

<p>The percentage utilisation for each half-hour for each data centre was determined via the following equation:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
<li class=""MsoNormal""><p>% Utilisation_data centre site = <br></p>
<p style=""text-align: left; color: #27187e"">
<i> SUM( <span style=""font-size: 10.5px;"">S_</span><sub>MPAN half-hourly observed import</sub>)<br></i>
<i style=""font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.9rem;""><u>                                                                                             </u></i></p>


<p style=""text-align: left; color: #27187e""><i> SUM( <span style=""font-size: 10.5px;"">S_</span><sub>MPAN Maximum Import Capacity</sub>)</i></p>
</li></ul>

<p>Where S = Apparent Power in kilovolt amperes (kVA)</p>

<p>To ensure the dataset includes only operational data centres, the dataset was then cleansed to exclude sites where utilisation was consistently at 0% across the year.</p>

<p>Based on the MPAN's address and corroboration with other open data sources, a data centre type was derived: either enterprise (i.e. company-owned and operated), or co-located (i.e. one company owns the data centre, but other customers operate IT load in the premises as tenants).</p>

<p>Each data centre site was then anonymised by removing any identifiers other than voltage level and UK Power Networks' view of the data centre type.</p>

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>

<p>The dataset is primarily built upon customer smart meter data for connected customer sites within the UK Power Networks' licence areas.
</p>

<p>The smart meter data that is used is sourced from external providers. While UK Power Networks does not control the quality of this data directly, these data have been incorporated into our models with careful validation and alignment.</p>

<p>Any missing or bad data has been addressed though robust data cleaning methods, such as omission.</p>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>

<p>The dataset is generated through a manual process, conducted by the Distribution System Operator's Regional Development Team.</p>

<p>The dataset will be reviewed quarterly - both in terms of the operational data centre sites identified, their maximum observed demands and their maximum import capacities - to assess any changes and determine if updates of demand specific profiles are necessary.</p>

<p>
Deriving the data centre type is a desktop-based process based on the MPAN's address and through corroboration with external, online sources.</p>

<p>This process ensures that the dataset remains relevant and reflective of real-world data centre usage over time.</p>

<p>There are sufficient data centre sites per voltage level to assure anonymity of data centre sites.</p>

The full NDP is published every other year, and the DFES NSHR is updated annually.</p><p>The 1 May 2025 DFES NSHR dataset uses the network loading from our the Long Term Development Statement November 2024 as baseline, and our <a href=""https://dso.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/distribution-future-energy-scenarios"" target=""_blank"">Distribution Future Energy Scenarios</a> 2025 for the future scenarios of demand and generation. </p><p>For further information on the NDP and the methodology to produce the DFES NSHR dataset please see <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"" target=""_blank"">Long Term Development Statement and Network Development Plan Landing Page</a></p><p>The DFES NSHR indicates the amount of unused network capacity for demand and generation over time to 2050 on our Bulk Supply Point and Primary substations. It shows where we may need to further reinforce our substations or procure flexibility services beyond our existing plans, if the energy system develops as indicated in each of our scenarios. Since the report indicates unused substation capacity in each year, please note unused capacity may be contractually committed to customers. Those seeking connection should contact our connections gateway to understand the latest view of available capacity.</p><p>The headroom tables show firm capacity - more capacity may be available for customers on a non-firm, flexible or curtailable connection.</p><p>The demand headroom tables reflect our latest firm capacity figures for demand, consistent with the May 2025 LTDS. The generation headroom tables reflect the equipment ratings in the November 2024 LTDS. </p><p>As noted in the methodology, unused substation capacity (headroom) is indicative and may be already contractually-committed to specific customers.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, including historical usage patterns, projected growth in renewable energy, and changes in regulatory frameworks.</li>
<li>Forecasting: The process begins with forecasting future network loads and demands. This often involves scenario planning to predict how energy consumption and generation will evolve to 2050. The forecast methodology is reviewed periodically to incorporate new data, stakeholder feedback, and changes in energy policy or technology. Stakeholder inputs including local authorities, developers, and energy providers are included to ensure the plans align with community needs and regulatory requirements.</li>
<li>Analysis of Network Capacity: Assessing the current capacity of the network to identify areas where reinforcement or upgrades are necessary. This includes our planning teams evaluating substations and distribution lines.</li>
<li>Option Development: Creating potential solutions to address identified constraints. This may involve traditional reinforcement methods or exploring flexibility services that can alleviate pressure on the network.</li>
<li>Reporting: Compiling findings into a structured report that outlines the methodology, assumptions, and planned interventions. This report is typically made available to the public for transparency.</li>
<li>Review and Update: The methodology is reviewed periodically to incorporate new data, stakeholder feedback, and changes in energy policy or technology.</li>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-primary-transformer-power-flow-historic-monthly,Primary Transformer Power Flow Historic Monthly,"<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>UK Power Network maintains the 132kV voltage level network and below. An important part of the distribution network is the stepping down of voltage as it is moved towards the household; this is achieved using transformers. Transformers have a maximum rating for the utilisation of these assets based upon protection, overcurrent, switch gear, etc. This dataset contains the <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Primary Substation Transformers,</span> that typically step-down voltage from 33kV to 11kV (occasionally from 132kV to 11kV). These transformers can be viewed on the single line diagrams in our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"">Long-Term Development Statements (LTDS)</a> and the underlying data is then found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/?disjunctive.theme&amp;disjunctive.dublin-core.subject&amp;sort=explore.popularity_score&amp;refine.dublin-core.subject=Long+Term+Development+Statements+(LTDS)"">LTDS tables</a>.</p><p>Care is taken to protect the private affairs of companies connected to the 11kV network, resulting in the redaction of certain transformers. Where redacted, <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">we provide monthly statistics</span> to continue to add value where possible. Where monthly statistics exist but half-hourly is absent, this data has been redacted.</p><p>This dataset provides monthly statistics data across these named transformers from 2021 through to the previous month across our license areas. The data are aligned with the same naming convention as the LTDS for improved interoperability.<br></p><p>To find  <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">half-hourly current and</span> <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">power flow </span>data for a transformer, use the ‘tx_id’ that can be cross referenced in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-primary-transformer-power-flow-historic-half-hourly/information/"" target=""_blank"">Primary Transformers Half Hourly Dataset</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>If you want to download all this data, it is perhaps more convenient from our public sharepoint: <o:p></o:p><a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/OpenDataPortalLibrary/Ei85WaNYHB1Jq5-mWF841ugBCUbCtPPKnJ2ziJbHDdyzmg?e=8qCXZl"">Open Data Portal Library - Primary Transformers - All Documents (sharepoint.com)</a></p><p>This dataset is part of a larger endeavour to share more operational data on UK Power Networks assets. Please visit our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/nodd/"">Network Operational Data Dashboard</a> for more operational datasets.</p><h2>Methodological Approach</h2><p>The dataset is not derived, it is the measurements from our network stored in our historian.</p><p>The measurement devices are taken from current transformers
attached to the cable at the circuit breaker, and power is derived combining this with the data from voltage transformers physically attached to the busbar. The historian stores datasets based on a report-by-exception process, such that a certain deviation from the present value must be reached before logging a point measurement to the historian. We extract the data following a 30-min time
weighted averaging method to get half-hourly values. Where there are no measurements logged in the period, the data provided is blank; due to the report-by-exception process, it may be appropriate to forward fill this data for shorter gaps.<o:p></o:p></p><p>We developed a data redactions process to protect the
privacy or companies according to the <a href=""https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/27/section/105"">Utilities Act
2000 section 105.1.b</a>, which requires UK Power Networks to not disclose information relating to the affairs of a business. For this reason, where the demand of a private customer is derivable from our data and that data is not already public information (e.g., data provided via Elexon on the Balancing Mechanism), we redact the half-hourly time series, and provide only the monthly
averages. This redaction process considers the correlation of all the data, of only corresponding periods where the customer is active, the first order difference of all the data, and the first order difference of only corresponding periods where the customer is active. Should any of these four tests have a high linear correlation, the data is deemed redacted. This process is not simply applied to only the circuit of the customer, but of the
surrounding circuits that would also reveal the signal of that customer.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The directionality of the data is not consistent within this dataset. Where directionality was ascertainable, we arrange the power data in the direction of the LTDS ""from node"" to the LTDS ""to node"". Measurements of current do not indicate directionality and are instead positive regardless of direction. In some circumstances, the polarity can be negative, and depends on the data commissioner's decision on what the operators in the control room might find most helpful in ensuring reliable and secure network operation.</p>
<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2><p>The data is provided ""as is"". </p><p>In the design and delivery process adopted by the DSO, customer feedback and guidance is considered at each phase of the project. One of the earliest steers was that raw data was preferable. This means that we do not perform prior quality control screening to our raw network data. The result
of this decision is that network rearrangements and other periods of non-intact running of the network are present throughout the dataset, which has the potential to misconstrue the true utilisation of the network, which is determined regulatorily by considering only by in-tact running arrangements. Therefore, taking the maximum or minimum of these transformers are not a reliable method of correctly ascertaining the true utilisation. This does have the intended added benefit of giving a realistic view of how the network was operated. The critical feedback was that our customers have a desire to understand what would have been the impact to them under real operational conditions. As such, this dataset offers unique insight into that.</p>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2><p>Creating this dataset involved a lot of human data
imputation. At UK Power Networks, we have differing software to run the network operationally (ADMS) and to plan and study the network (PowerFactory). The measurement devices are intended to primarily inform the network operators of the real time condition of the network, and importantly, the network drawings visible in the LTDS are a planning approach, which differs to the operational. To compile this dataset, we made the union between the two modes of operating manually. A team of data scientists, data engineers, and power system engineers manually identified the LTDS transformer from the single line diagram, identified the line name from LTDS Table 2a/b, then identified the same transformer in ADMS to identify the measurement data tags. This was then manually inputted
to a spreadsheet. Any influential customers to that circuit were noted using ADMS and the single line diagrams. From there, a python code is used to perform the triage and compilation of the datasets. <o:p></o:p></p><p>There is potential for human error during the manual data processing. These issues can include missing transformers, incorrectly labelled transformers, incorrectly identified measurement data tags, incorrectly interpreted directionality.

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-standard-profiles-electricity-demand,Standard Profiles UK Power Networks Uses for Electricity Demand,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The dataset captures yearly load profiles for different demand types, used by UK Power Networks to run import curtailment assessment studies.</p>

<p> The import curtailment assessment tool has gone live across all three licence areas in September 2024, and uses the standard demand profiles in this data publication to model accepted not-yet-connected demand customers for import curtailment studies.   </p>

<p> Demand specific profile include the following demand types: commercial, industrial, domestic, EV charging stations, bus charging depots, network rail and data centres.  </p>

<p>The profiles have been developed using actual demand data from connected sites within UK Power Networks licence areas falling into each of the demand categories. The output is a yearly profile with half hourly granularity. </p>

<p>The values are expressed as load factors (percentages) i.e., at each half hour the value can range from 0% to 100% of the maximum import capacity.  </p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>This section outlines the methodology for generating annual half-hourly demand profiles. </p>

<p>A minimum of ten connected demand sites for each of the demand types have been used to create the representative profiles. </p>

<p>Historical data from each of these connected demand sites are either retrieved from UK Power Networks’ Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) or through smart meter data. The historical data collected consist of annual half-hourly meter readings in the last calendar year. </p> 

<p>A Python script was used to process the half-hourly MW data from each of the sites, which have been normalize by the peak MW values from the same site, for each timestamp, as follows: </p>

P<sub>t</sub> (p.u) = P<sub>1, t</sub>Pmax<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2, t</sub>Pmax<sub>2</sub> + … + P<sub>n, t</sub>Pmax<sub>n</sub>

<br>
<br>
where
<ul>
<li>P,t(p.u) is normalised power</li>
<li>P is the import in MW from sites 1, 2, ..., n</li>
<li>Pmax is max import in the last calendar year, from site 1, 2, ..., n</li>
<li>t is time, 30 minutes resolution for one year</li>
</ul>


<p>The final profile has been created by selecting a percentile ranging from 95 to 98%.  </p>

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>The dataset is primarily built upon RTU data sourced from connected customer sites within the UK Power Networks' licence areas as well as data collected from customers smart meters.</p>

<p>For the RTU data, UK Power Networks' Ops Telecoms team continuously monitors the performance of RTUs to ensure that the data they provide is both accurate and reliable. RTUs are equipped to store data during communication outages and transmit it once the connection is restored, minimizing the risk of data gaps. An alarm system alerts the team to any issues with RTUs, ensuring rapid response and repair to maintain data integrity.</p>

<p>The smart meter data that is used to support certain demand profiles, such as domestic and smaller commercial profiles, is sourced from external providers. While UK Power Networks does not control the quality of this data directly, these data have been incorporated to our models with careful validation and alignment.</p>

<p>Where MW was not available, data conversions were performed to standardize all units to MW. Any missing or bad data has been addressed though robust data cleaning methods, such as forward filling.</p>

<p>The final profiles have been validated by ensuring that the profile aligned with expected operational patterns.</p>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>
<p>The dataset is generated using a script developed by the Network Access team, allowing an automated conversion from historical half hourly data to a yearly profile. The profiles will be reviewed annually to assess any changes in demand patterns and determine if updates of demand specific profiles are necessary. This process ensures that the profiles remain relevant and reflective of real-world demand dynamics over time. </p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-grid-transformer-operational-data-monthly,Grid Transformer Power Flow Historic Monthly,"<h2>Introduction</h2><p>UK Power Network maintains the 132kV voltage level network and below. An important part of the distribution network is the stepping down of voltage as it is moved towards the household; this is achieved using transformers. Transformers have a maximum rating for the utilisation of these assets based upon protection, overcurrent, switch gear, etc. This dataset contains the <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">Grid Substation Transformers</span>, also known as Bulk Supply Points, that typically step-down voltage from 132kV to 33kV (occasionally down to 66 or more rarely 20-25). These transformers can be viewed on the single line diagrams in our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"">Long-Term Development Statements (LTDS)</a> and the underlying data is then found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/?disjunctive.theme&amp;disjunctive.keyword&amp;sort=title&amp;refine.keyword=LTDS"">LTDS tables</a>.</p><p>Care is taken to protect the private affairs of companies connected to the 33kV network, resulting in the redaction of certain transformers. Where redacted, <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">we provide monthly statistics</span> to continue to add value where possible. Where monthly statistics exist but half-hourly is absent, this data has been redacted.</p><p>This dataset provides monthly statistics data across these named transformers from 2021 through to the previous month across our license areas. The data are aligned with the same naming convention as the LTDS for improved interoperability.<br></p><p>To find  <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">half-hourly current and</span> <span style=""font-weight: bolder;"">power flow </span>data for a transformer, use the ‘tx_id’ that can be cross referenced in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-grid-transformer-operational-data-half-hourly/information/"" target=""_blank"">Grid Transformers Half Hourly Dataset</a>.<o:p></o:p></p><p>If you want to download all this data, it is perhaps more convenient from our public sharepoint: <o:p></o:p><a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.sharepoint.com/sites/OpenDataPortalLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?ga=1&amp;id=%2Fsites%2FOpenDataPortalLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FOperational%20Data%2FGrid%20Transformers&amp;viewid=2e8ce4fd%2D616b%2D4a28%2Dbf3c%2Dfd030122b846"">Open Data Portal Library - Grid Transformers - All Documents (sharepoint.com)</a></p><p>This dataset is part of a larger endeavour to share more operational data on UK Power Networks assets. Please visit our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/nodd/"">Network Operational Data Dashboard</a> for more operational datasets.</p><h2>Methodological Approach</h2><p>The dataset is not derived, it is the measurements from our network stored in our historian.</p><p>The measurement devices are taken from current transformers
attached to the cable at the circuit breaker, and power is derived combining this with the data from voltage transformers physically attached to the busbar. The historian stores datasets based on a report-by-exception process, such that a certain deviation from the present value must be reached before logging a point measurement to the historian. We extract the data following a 30-min time
weighted averaging method to get half-hourly values. Where there are no measurements logged in the period, the data provided is blank; due to the report-by-exception process, it may be appropriate to forward fill this data for shorter gaps.<o:p></o:p></p><p>We developed a data redactions process to protect the
privacy or companies according to the <a href=""https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/27/section/105"">Utilities Act
2000 section 105.1.b</a>, which requires UK Power Networks to not disclose information relating to the affairs of a business. For this reason, where the demand of a private customer is derivable from our data and that data is not already public information (e.g., data provided via Elexon on the Balancing Mechanism), we redact the half-hourly time series, and provide only the monthly
averages. This redaction process considers the correlation of all the data, of only corresponding periods where the customer is active, the first order difference of all the data, and the first order difference of only corresponding periods where the customer is active. Should any of these four tests have a high linear correlation, the data is deemed redacted. This process is not simply applied to only the circuit of the customer, but of the
surrounding circuits that would also reveal the signal of that customer.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The directionality of the data is not consistent within this dataset. Where directionality was ascertainable, we arrange the power data in the direction of the LTDS ""from node"" to the LTDS ""to node"". Measurements of current do not indicate directionality and are instead positive regardless of direction. In some circumstances, the polarity can be negative, and depends on the data commissioner's decision on what the operators in the control room might find most helpful in ensuring reliable and secure network operation.</p><h2>Quality Control Statement</h2><p>The data is provided ""as is"". </p><p>In the design and delivery process adopted by the DSO, customer feedback and guidance is considered at each phase of the project. One of the earliest steers was that raw data was preferable. This means that we do not perform prior quality control screening to our raw network data. The result
of this decision is that network rearrangements and other periods of non-intact running of the network are present throughout the dataset, which has the potential to misconstrue the true utilisation of the network, which is determined regulatorily by considering only by in-tact running arrangements. Therefore, taking the maximum or minimum of these transformers are not a reliable method of correctly ascertaining the true utilisation. This does have the intended added benefit of giving a realistic view of how the network was operated. The critical feedback was that our customers have a desire to understand what would have been the impact to them under real operational conditions. As such, this dataset offers unique insight into that.</p><h2>Assurance Statement</h2><p>Creating this dataset involved a lot of human data
imputation. At UK Power Networks, we have differing software to run the network operationally (ADMS) and to plan and study the network (PowerFactory). The measurement devices are intended to primarily inform the network operators of the real time condition of the network, and importantly, the network drawings visible in the LTDS are a planning approach, which differs to the operational. To compile this dataset, we made the union between the two modes of operating manually. A team of data scientists, data engineers, and power system engineers manually identified the LTDS transformer from the single line diagram, identified the line name from LTDS Table 2a/b, then identified the same transformer in ADMS to identify the measurement data tags. This was then manually inputted
to a spreadsheet. Any influential customers to that circuit were noted using ADMS and the single line diagrams. From there, a python code is used to perform the triage and compilation of the datasets. <o:p></o:p></p><p>There is potential for human error during the manual data processing. These issues can include missing transformers, incorrectly labelled transformers, incorrectly identified measurement data tags, incorrectly interpreted directionality. Whilst care has been taken to minimise the risk of
these issues, they may persist in the provided dataset. Any uncertain behaviour observed by using this data should be reported to allow us to correct as fast as possible.<o:p></o:p></p><h2>Additional information</h2><p>Definitions of key terms related to this dataset can be found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/glossary/"">Open Data Portal Glossary</a>.</p><p>Download dataset information: <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/domain-dataset0/download/?format=json&amp;refine.identifier=ukpn-grid-transformer-operational-data-monthly"">Metadata (JSON)</a></p><p>We would be grateful if you find this dataset useful to

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-constraints-real-time-meter-readings,Constraints Real Time Meter Readings,"<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class=""standard-text"">Generation customers connected to UK Power Networks can be subjected to curtailment through our Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) if they accepted a curtailable-connection.</p>
<p class=""standard-text"">During periods of network congestion, these DERS will have their access reduced to mitigate network constraint breaches. Their reduction is organised according to their connection application date in a last-in first-out (LIFO) arrangement.</p>
<p class=""standard-text"">The Constraints Real Time Meter Readings dataset on the Open Data Portal (ODP) gives a near real time status of the constraints on our network that are used by DERMS to reduce access.</p>
<p class=""standard-text"">This API accessible dataset can be used to see just how congested the network is, and for the specific DER operators themselves, they have access and visibility to the constraints of their specific site.</p>
<p class=""standard-text"">The dataset contains a timestamp, the constraint identifier, the most recent current reading in amps, the trim and release limits (curtailment starts at the trim and ends at the release), whether the site is in breach, a description of the constraint, and (only if you have access) the name of the DER.</p>
<p class=""standard-text"">The dataset updates as close to real time as is possible. Our scheduling is as follows:</p>
<ul class=""standard-text"">
  <li>At 15s past the minute mark, we scrape the network data and push it to the ODP server</li>
  <li>On the minute mark, the ODP runs an update to refresh the dataset</li>
  <li>The dataset refresh is completed between 5-15s past the minute mark</li>
  <li>Only after this refresh has completed can you get the latest values from the ODP</li>
</ul>
<p class=""standard-text"">You can run this notebook to see the dataset in action:</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<ul class=""standard-text"">
  <li>A Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is installed at each curtailable-connection site providing live telemetry data into the DERMS. It measures communications status, generator output, and mode of operation.</li>
  <li>RTUs are also installed at constraint locations (physical parts of the network, e.g., transformers, cables which may become overloaded under certain conditions). These are identified through planning power load studies. These RTUs monitor current at the constraint and communications status.</li>
  <li>The DERMS design integrates network topology information. This maps constraints to associated curtailable connections under different network running conditions, including the sensitivity of the constraints to each curtailable connection. In general, a 1MW reduction in generation of a customer will cause &lt;1MW reduction at the constraint. Each constraint is registered to a GSP.</li>
  <li>DERMS monitors constraints against the associated breach limit. When a constraint limit is breached, DERMS calculates the amount of access reduction required from curtailable connections linked to the constraint to alleviate the breach. This calculation factors in the real-time level of generation of each customer and the sensitivity of the constraint to each generator.</li>
  <li>Access reduction is issued to each curtailable-connection via the RTU until the constraint limit breach is mitigated.</li>
  <li>Multiple constraints can apply to a curtailable-connection and constraint breaches can occur simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Where multiple constraint breaches act upon a single curtailable-connection, we apportion the access reduction of that connection to the constraint breaches depending on the relative magnitude of the breaches.</li>
  <li>Where customer curtailment occurs without any associated constraint breach, we categorize the curtailment as non-constraint driven.</li>
  <li>Future developments will include the reason for non-constraint driven curtailment.</li>
</ul>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-sensitivity-factors-import,Sensitivity Factors (Import),"<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><span>This dataset provides Sensitivity Factors (SFs) for UK Power Networks' three licence areas. </span>

<span>SFs represent the marginal impact of a power injection at a node on the network to branches (lines or transformers) elsewhere. They provide a simplified, linearised way of modelling the marginal impact of a MW generated in one part of the network on key constraints and are therefore widely used to model distributed energy resources (DERs) on the network. This analysis can be critical to developers assessing new projects.</span></p>

<p>This dataset is calculated under an Import scenario of maximum demand and minimum generation. Please see the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-sensitivity-factors-export/table/"" target=""_blank"">SFs (Export) dataset</a> for sensitivity factors conducted under maximum generation, minimum demand conditions.<span style=""font-family: inherit; font-size: 0.875rem;""> </span></p>

<h2><span>Methodology: </span></h2>

<p><span>SFs are calculated in PowerFactory based on an AC load flow. When calculating SFs for lines/cables/circuits, SFs are calculated between the node, which is where the import/export of power will take place, and the branch, which is where the change in power will be felt. For example, 1 MW injected at the node would have 0.8 MW decrease at the branch if the SF between the node and branch is -0.8.  For transformers, we model between the HV node and the LV node. The SF values given are a fraction, dP/dP, that is, the increase or decrease in MW flow along the branch, resulting from a 1 MW active power injection at the node. </span></p>

<p>The SFs are calculated under static network conditions and in intact running arrangements. They are a useful approximation of network suitable for modelling purposes, but do not reflect the real-time variability resulting from changing running arrangements and network loading.</p>

<p>SFs are calculated on a per-Grid Supply Point basis: SFs are not provided between nodes and branches in different Grid Supply Points.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-large-demand-queue,Large Demand Queue,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This dataset
      shows an anonymised list of live, committed, import-related projects
      within UK Power Networks' licence areas. This includes demand-only
      projects that are 5,000 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and above, as well as
      battery energy storage systems (BESS).
</p>
<p>This
      list has been determined using internal systems UK Power Networks uses to
      manage all committed projects in the process of connecting to our
      network.</p>
<p>To
      protect the identity of the sites, entries have been anonymised and only
      the licence area, the grid supply point the project is connecting at (or
      under), rounded requested import capacity, and application date have been
      provided.


</p><h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>Live, committed demand projects are identified through desktop exercises using UK Power Networks' internal customer relationship management system and extracted. </p>
 
<p>The projects are then filtered to only show projects where </p><ul><li>The required import capacity is more than or equal to 5,000kVA</li><li>The required export capacity is 0MVA.</li></ul>
 
<p>These project entries are then cross-referenced with other sources to verify its status. Any discrepancies are manually reviewed and kept/omitted as appropriate.</p><div>To protect the identity of the demand projects the required import capacity is rounded, and the project names are anonymised by providing an arbitrary sequential number.</div><div><br></div>

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<ul><li>The dataset is primarily built upon internal data, relating to live demand projects in UK Power Networks' licence areas. </li><li>Information about battery energy storage systems are taken from existing datasets relating to Appendix G information UK Power Networks manages.</li><li>Data have been checked with both automatic and manual validation methods.</li></ul>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>
<p>The dataset is generated through a manual process, conducted by the Distribution System Operator's Regional Development Team. The dataset will be reviewed monthly to assess any changes, and to determine if any updates to the methodology are necessary.
This process ensures that the dataset remains relevant and reflective of the live large demand projects UK Power Networks is working on.
There are sufficient projects per licence area to assure anonymity of projects.</p><p>While all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the information provided in this dataset, neither the licensee nor any of its directors or employees is under any liability for any errors, or for any misstatement on which a user of the data seeks to rely.

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-data-centre-utilisation,Data Centre Utilisation,"<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This dataset shows the maximum observed utilisations of operational data centres identified in UK Power Networks' region.</p>


<p>The utilisations have been determined using actual demand data from connected sites within UK Power Networks licence areas, from 1 January 2023 onwards.</p>


<p>Maximum utilisations are expressed proportionally, by comparing the maximum half-hourly observed import power seen across the site's meter point(s), against the meter's maximum import capacity. Units for both measures are apparent power, in kilovolt amperes (kVA). </p>


<p>To protect the identity of the sites, data points have been anonymised and only the site's voltage level information has been provided - and our estimation of the data centre type - has been provided. </p>


<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>


<p>Over 100 operational data centre sites (and at least 10 per voltage  level) were identified through internal desktop exercises and corroboration with external sources. </p>


<p>After identifying these sites, their addresses and their MPAN(s) (Meter Point Administration Number(s)) were identified using internal systems.</p>


<p>Half-hourly smart meter import data were retrieved using internal systems. This included both half-hourly meter data, and static data (such as the MPAN's maximum import capacity and voltage group, the latter through the MPAN's Line Loss Factor Class Description). Half-hourly meter import data came in the form of active and reactive power, and the apparent power was calculated using the power triangle.</p>


<p>In cases where there are numerous meter points for a given data centre site, the observed import powers across all relevant meter points are summed, and compared against the sum total of maximum import capacity for the meters.</p>

<p>The maximum utilisation for each site was determined via the following equation (where S = Apparent Power in kilovolt amperes (kVA)):</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
<li class=""MsoNormal""><p>% Maximum Observed Utilisation = <br></p>

<p style=""text-align: left; color: #27187e""><i> SUM( S<sub>MPAN Maximum Import Capacity</sub>)</i></p>
</li></ul>

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>

<p>The dataset is primarily built upon customer smart meter data for connected customer sites within the UK Power Networks' licence areas.</p>

<p>The smart meter data that is used is sourced from external providers. While UK Power Networks does not control the quality of this data directly, these data have been incorporated into our models with careful validation and alignment.</p>

<p>Any  missing or bad data has been addressed though robust data cleaning methods, such as omission.</p>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>

<p>The dataset is generated through a manual process, conducted by the Distribution System Operator's Regional Development Team.</p>

<p>The dataset will be reviewed quarterly - both in terms of the operational data centre sites identified, their maximum observed demands and their maximum import capacities - to assess any changes and determine if updates of demand specific profiles are necessary.
<br><br>
This process ensures that the dataset remains relevant and reflective of real-world data centre usage over time.</p>

<p>There are sufficient data centre sites per voltage level to assure anonymity of data centre sites.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-33kv-circuit-operational-data-half-hourly-spn,33kV Circuit Operational Data Half Hourly - South Eastern Power Networks (SPN),"<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>UK Power Network maintains the 132kV voltage level network and below.  An important part of the distribution network is distributing this electricity across our regions through circuits. Electricity enters our network through Super Grid Transformers at substations shared with National Grid we call Grid Supply Points. It is then sent at across our 132 kV Circuits towards our grid substations and primary substations. From there, electricity is distributed along the 33 kV circuits to bring it closer to the home.  These circuits can be viewed on the single line diagrams in our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"" target=""_blank"">Long-Term Development Statements (LTDS)</a> and the underlying data is then found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/?disjunctive.theme&amp;disjunctive.dublin-core.subject&amp;sort=explore.popularity_score&amp;refine.dublin-core.subject=Long+Term+Development+Statements+(LTDS)"" target=""_blank"">LTDS tables</a>.  <br></p>

<p>This dataset provides <b>half-hourly current and power flow data</b> across these named circuits from 2021 through to the previous month in our South Eastern Power Networks (SPN) licence area. The data are aligned with the same naming convention as the LTDS for improved interoperability. 

Care is taken to protect the private affairs of companies connected to the 33 kV network, resulting in the redaction of certain circuits. Where redacted, we provide monthly statistics to continue to add value where possible. Where monthly statistics exist but half-hourly is absent, this data has been redacted. 

To find which circuit you are looking for, use the ‘ltds_line_name’ that can be cross referenced in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-33kv-circuit-operational-data-monthly/information/"" target=""_blank"">33kV Circuits Monthly Data</a>, which describes by month what circuits were triaged, if they could be made public, and what the monthly statistics are of that site.  <br></p>

<p>If you want to download all this data, it is perhaps more convenient from our public sharepoint:  <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/OpenDataPortalLibrary/EszEqOOgtutOq9b1lgCR7AgB55wpl4PfPyMfyAnqghsCUg?e=wZ8elf"" target=""_blank"">Sharepoint</a></p>

<p>This dataset is part of a larger endeavour to share more operational data on UK Power Networks assets. Please visit our Network Operational Data Dashboard for more operational datasets.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>The dataset is not derived, it is the measurements from our network stored in our historian. </p><p>The measurement devices are taken from current transformers attached to the cable at the circuit breaker, and power is derived combining this with the data from voltage transformers physically attached to the busbar. The historian stores datasets based on a report-by-exception process, such that a certain deviation from the present value must be reached before logging a point measurement to the historian. We extract the data following a 30-min time weighted averaging method to get half-hourly values.

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>The data is provided ""as is"".  </p>
<p>In the design and delivery process adopted by the DSO, customer feedback and guidance is considered at each phase of the project. One of the earliest steers was that raw data was preferable. This means that we do not perform prior quality control screening to our raw network data. The result of this decision is that network rearrangements and other periods of non-intact running of the network are present throughout the dataset, which has the potential to misconstrue the true utilisation of the network, which is determined regulatorily by considering only by in-tact running arrangements. Therefore, taking the maximum or minimum of these measurements are not a reliable method of correctly ascertaining the true utilisation. This does have the intended added benefit of giving a realistic view of how the network was operated. The critical feedback was that our customers have a desire to understand what would have been the impact to them under real operational conditions. As such, this dataset offers unique insight into that.</p>
<h2>Assurance Statement</h2><p>Creating this dataset involved a lot of human data imputation. At UK Power Networks, we have differing software to run the network operationally (ADMS) and to plan and study the network (PowerFactory). The measurement devices are intended to primarily inform the network operators of the real time condition of the network, and importantly, the network drawings visible in the LTDS are a planning approach, which differs to the operational. To compile this dataset, we made the union between the two modes of operating manually. A team of data scientists, data engineers, and power system engineers manually identified the LTDS circuit from the single line diagram, identified the line name from LTDS Table 2a/b, then identified the same circuit in ADMS to identify the measurement data tags. This was then manually inputted to a spreadsheet. Any influential customers to that circuit were noted using ADMS and the single line diagrams. From there, a python code is used to perform the triage and compilation of the datasets.  </p><p>There is potential for human error during the manual data processing. These issues can include missing circuits, incorrectly labelled circuits, incorrectly identified measurement data tags, incorrectly interpreted directionality. Whilst care has been taken to minimise the risk of these issues, they may persist in the provided dataset.

<p>Our peak demand scenarios indicate the winter and summer peak demands to 2050 for all Grid and primary substations owned by UK Power Networks which serve demand, based on our <a href=""https://dso.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/distribution-future-energy-scenarios"" target=""_blank"">Distribution Future Energy Scenarios</a> (DFES). </p><p>The peak demand scenarios are in the same format as Table 3B of the Long Term Development Statement (LTDS) but show a forecast to 2050 instead of for five years ahead. The LTDS Table 3B shows the best-view planning scenario called Holistic Transition, whereas the peak demand scenarios represent how DFES is converted to substation peak demands for multiple scenarios. </p><p>The peak demand scenarios are an input to producing the DFES Network Scenario Headroom Report (NSHR) for demand, and are being published alongside the NSHR. </p>
<p>For further information on the LTDS, NDP and NSHR,  please see <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"" target=""_blank"">Long Term Development Statement and Network Development Plan Landing Page</a></p><p>The firm capacity figures in the 1 May 2025 peak demand scenarios are consistent with the 31 May 2025 LTDS Table 3B and the 1 May 2025 NSHR.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, including historical usage patterns, projected growth in renewable energy, and changes in regulatory frameworks.</li>
<li>Forecasting: The process begins with forecasting future network loads and demands. This often involves scenario planning to predict how energy consumption and generation will evolve to 2050. The forecast methodology is reviewed periodically to incorporate new data, stakeholder feedback, and changes in energy policy or technology. Stakeholder inputs including local authorities, developers, and energy providers are included to ensure the plans align with community needs and regulatory requirements.</li>
<li>Analysis of Network Capacity: Assessing the current capacity of the network to identify areas where reinforcement or upgrades are necessary. This includes our planning teams evaluating substations and distribution lines.</li>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-33kv-circuit-operational-data-half-hourly-epn,33kV Circuit Operational Data Half Hourly - Eastern Power Networks (EPN),"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>UK Power Network maintains the 132kV voltage level network and below. An important part of the distribution network is distributing this electricity across our regions through circuits.  Electricity enters our network through Super Grid Transformers at substations shared with National Grid we call Grid Supply Points. It is then sent at across our 132 kV Circuits towards our grid substations and primary substations. From there, electricity is distributed along the 33 kV circuits to bring it closer to the home.  These circuits can be viewed on the single line diagrams in our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"" target=""_blank"">Long-Term Development Statements (LTDS)</a> and the underlying data is then found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/?disjunctive.theme&amp;disjunctive.dublin-core.subject&amp;sort=explore.popularity_score&amp;refine.dublin-core.subject=Long+Term+Development+Statements+(LTDS)"" target=""_blank"">LTDS tables</a>.  <br></p>

<p>This dataset provides <b>half-hourly current and power flow data</b> across these named circuits from 2021 through to the previous month across our Eastern Power Networks (EPN) license area. The data is aligned with the same naming convention as the LTDS for improved interoperability. </p>

<p>Care is taken to protect the private affairs of companies connected to the 33 kV network, resulting in the redaction of certain circuits. Where redacted, we provide monthly statistics to continue to add value where possible. Where monthly statistics exist but half-hourly is absent, this data has been redacted. </p>

<p>To find which circuit you are looking for, use the ‘ltds_line_name’ that can be cross referenced in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-33kv-circuit-operational-data-monthly/information/"" target=""_blank"">33kV Circuits Monthly Data</a>, which describes by month what circuits were triaged, if they could be made public, and what the monthly statistics are of that site. <br></p>

<p>If you want to download all this data, it is perhaps more convenient from our public sharepoint:  <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/OpenDataPortalLibrary/EszEqOOgtutOq9b1lgCR7AgB55wpl4PfPyMfyAnqghsCUg?e=wZ8elf"" target=""_blank"">Sharepoint</a></p>
<p>This dataset is part of a larger endeavour to share more operational data on UK Power Networks assets. Please visit our Network Operational Data Dashboard for more operational datasets.</p>
<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>The dataset is not derived, it is the measurements from our network stored in our historian. </p>
<p>The measurement devices are taken from current transformers attached to the cable at the circuit breaker, and power is derived combining this with the data from voltage transformers physically attached to the busbar. The historian stores datasets based on a report-by-exception process, such that a certain deviation from the present value must be reached before logging a point measurement to the historian. We extract the data following a 30-min time weighted averaging method to get half-hourly values. Where there are no measurements logged in the period, the data provided is blank; due to the report-by-exception process, it may be appropriate to forward fill this data for shorter gaps. </p>
<p>We developed a data redactions process to protect the privacy or companies according to the <a href=""https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/27/section/105"" target=""_blank"">Utilities Act 2000 section 105.1.b</a>, which requires UK Power Networks to not disclose information relating to the affairs of a business. For this reason, where the demand of a private customer is derivable from our data and that data is not already public information (e.g., data provided via Elexon on the Balancing Mechanism), we redact the half-hourly time series, and provide only the monthly averages. This redaction process considers the correlation of all the data, of only corresponding periods where the customer is active, the first order difference of all the data, and the first order difference of only corresponding periods where the customer is active. Should any of these four tests have a high linear correlation, the data is deemed redacted. This process is not simply applied to only the circuit of the customer, but of the surrounding circuits that would also reveal the signal of that customer. </p>

<p>Care is taken to protect the private affairs of companies connected to the 132 kV network, resulting in the redaction of certain circuits. Where redacted, we provide monthly statistics to continue to add value where possible. Where monthly statistics exist but half-hourly is absent, this data has been redacted.</p>

<p>To find which circuit you are looking for, use the ‘ltds_line_name’ that can be cross-referenced in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-132kv-circuit-operational-data-monthly/information/"" target=""_blank"">132kV Circuits Monthly Data</a>, which describes by month what circuits were triaged, if they could be made public, and what the monthly statistics are of that site.</p>

<p>This dataset is part of a larger endeavour to share more operational data on UK Power Networks assets. Please visit our Network Operational Data Dashboard for more operational datasets.</p>

<h1>Methodological Approach</h1>

<p>The dataset is not derived, it is the measurements from our network stored in our historian.</p>

<p>The measurement devices are taken from current transformers attached to the cable at the circuit breaker, and power is derived combining this with the data from voltage transformers physically attached to the busbar. The historian stores datasets based on a report-by-exception process, such that a certain deviation from the present value must be reached before logging a point measurement to the historian. We extract the data following a 30-min time weighted averaging method to get half-hourly values. Where there are no measurements logged in the period, the data provided is blank; due to the report-by-exception process, it may be appropriate to forward fill this data for shorter gaps.</p>

<p>We developed a data redactions process to protect the privacy of companies according to the <a href=""https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/27/section/105"" target=""_blank"">Utilities Act 2000 section 105.1.b</a>, which requires UK Power Networks to not disclose information relating to the affairs of a business. For this reason, where the demand of a private customer is derivable from our data and that data is not already public information (e.g., data provided via Elexon on the Balancing Mechanism), we redact the half-hourly time series, and provide only the monthly averages. This redaction process considers the correlation of all the data, of only corresponding periods where the customer is active, the first order difference of all the data, and the first order difference of only corresponding periods where the customer is active. Should any of these four tests have a high linear correlation, the data is deemed redacted. This process is not simply applied to only the circuit of the customer, but of the surrounding circuits that would also reveal the signal of that customer.</p>

<p>The directionality of the data is not consistent within this dataset. Where directionality was ascertainable, we arrange the power data in the direction of the LTDS ""from node"" to the LTDS ""to node"". Measurements of current do not indicate directionality and are instead positive regardless of direction. In some circumstances, the polarity can be negative, and depends on the data commissioner's decision on what the operators in the control room might find most helpful in ensuring reliable and secure network operation.</p>

<h1>Quality Control Statement</h1>

<p>The data is provided ""as is"".</p>

<p>In the design and delivery process adopted by the DSO, customer feedback and guidance is considered at each phase of the project. One of the earliest steers was that raw data was preferable. This means that we do not perform prior quality control screening to our raw network data. The result of this decision is that network rearrangements and other periods of non-intact running of the network are present throughout the dataset, which has the potential to misconstrue the true utilisation of the network, which is determined regulatorily by considering only by in-tact running arrangements. Therefore, taking the maximum or minimum of these measurements are not a reliable method of correctly ascertaining the true utilisation. This does have the intended added benefit of giving a realistic view of how the network was operated. The critical feedback was that our customers have a desire to understand what would have been the impact to them under real operational conditions. As such, this dataset offers unique insight into that.</p>

<h1>Assurance Statement</h1>

<p>Creating this dataset involved a lot of human data imputation. At UK Power Networks, we have differing software to run the network operationally (ADMS) and to plan and study the network (PowerFactory). The measurement devices are intended to primarily inform the network operators of the real time condition of the network, and importantly, the network drawings visible in the LTDS are a planning approach, which differs to the operational. To compile this dataset, we made the union between the two modes of operating manually. A team of data scientists, data engineers, and power system engineers manually identified the LTDS circuit from the single line diagram, identified the line name from LTDS Table 2a/b, then identified the same circuit in ADMS to identify the measurement data tags. This was then manually inputted to a spreadsheet. Any influential customers to that circuit were noted using ADMS and the single line diagrams. From there, a python code is used to perform the triage and compilation of the datasets.</p>

<p>There is potential for human error during the manual data processing. These issues can include missing circuits, incorrectly labelled circuits, incorrectly identified measurement data tags, incorrectly interpreted directionality. Whilst care has been taken to minimise the risk of these issues, they may persist in the provided dataset. Any uncertain behaviour observed by using this data should be reported to allow us to correct as fast as possible.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-constraint-breaches-history,Constraint Breaches History,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This dataset records all curtailment events experienced by curtailable-connection customers.<br></p>
<h2>About Curtailment</h2>
<p>When a generation customer requests a firm connection
under a congested part of our network, there may be a requirement to reinforce
the network to accommodate the connection. The reinforcement works take time to
complete which increases the lead time to connect for the customer.
Furthermore, the customer may need to contribute to the cost of the
reinforcement works.<o:p></o:p></p><p>UK Power Networks offers curtailable-connections as an alternative
solution for our customers. It allows customers to connect to the distribution
network as soon as possible<i> </i>rather than waiting, and potentially paying,
for network reinforcement. This is possible because under a curtailable
connection, the customer agrees that their access to the network can be
controlled when congestion is high. These fast-tracked curtailable-connections can
transition to firm connections once the reinforcement activity has taken place.
Curtailable connections have enabled faster and cheaper connection of renewable
energy generation to the distribution network owned and operated by UK Power
Networks.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The Distribution System Operator (DSO) team has
developed the Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) that monitors
curtailable-connection generators as well as associated constraints on the
network. When a constraint reaches a critical threshold, an export access
reduction signal may be sent to generators associated with that constraint so
that the network can be kept safe, secure, and reliable.<o:p></o:p></p><p>This dataset contains a record of curtailment actions
we have taken and the resultant access reduction experienced by our curtailment-connections
customers. Access reduction is calculated as the MW access reduction from
maximum × duration of access reduction in hours (MW×h). The dataset categorises
curtailment actions into 2 categories:</p>
<ul><li>Constraint-driven curtailment: when a constraint is
breached, we aggregate the access reduction of all customers associated with
that constraint. A constraint breach occurs when the network load exceeds the
safe limit.</li> <br>
<li>Non-constraint driven curtailment: this covers all
curtailment which is not directly related to a constraint breach on the
network. It includes customer comms failures, non-compliance trips (where the
customer has not complied with a curtailment instruction), planned outages and
unplanned outages</li></ul>
<p>Each row in the dataset details the start and end
times, durations and customer access reduction associated with a curtailment
actions. We also provide the associated grid supply point (GSP) and nominal
voltage to provide greater aggregation capabilities.<br></p>
<p>By virtue of being able to track curtailment across
our network in granular detail, we have managed to significantly reduce curtailment
of our curtailable-connections customers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p></p><ul><li>A
Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is installed at each curtailable-connection site providing
live telemetry data into the DERMS. It measures communications status,
generator output and mode of operation.<o:p></o:p></li>
<li>RTUs
are also installed at constraint locations (physical parts of the network,
e.g., transformers, cables which may become overloaded under certain conditions).
These are identified through planning power load studies. These RTUs monitor
current at the constraint and communications status.<o:p></o:p></li>
<li>The
DERMS design integrates network topology information. This maps constraints to associated
curtailable connections under different network running conditions, including
the sensitivity of the constraints to each curtailable connection. In general,
a 1MW reduction in generation of a customer will cause &lt;1MW reduction at the
constraint. Each constraint is registered to a GSP.<o:p></o:p></li><li>DERMS
monitors constraints against the associated breach limit. When a constraint
limit is breached, DERMS calculates the amount of access reduction required
from curtailable connections linked to the constraint to alleviate the breach.
This calculation factors in the real-time level of generation of each customer
and the sensitivity of the constraint to each generator. <o:p></o:p></li>
<li>Access
reduction is issued to each curtailable-connection via the RTU until the
constraint limit breach is mitigated. <o:p></o:p></li>
<li>Multiple
constraints can apply to a curtailable-connection and constraint breaches can
occur simultaneously. <o:p></o:p></li>
<li>Where
multiple constraint breaches act upon a single curtailable-connection, we
apportion the access reduction of that connection to the constraint breaches
depending on the relative magnitude of the breaches. <o:p></o:p></li>
<li>Where
customer curtailment occurs without any associated constraint breach, we categorise

<li>Future

<h2>Quality Control Statement<br></h2>
<p>The dataset is derived from data recorded by RTUs
located at customer sites and constraint locations across our network. UKPN’s Ops
Telecoms team monitors and maintains these RTUs to ensure they are providing
accurate customer/network data. An alarms system notifies the team of
communications failures which are attended to by our engineers as quickly as
possible. RTUs can store telemetry data for prolonged periods during
communications outages and then transmit data once communications are
reinstated. These measures ensure we have a continuous stream of accurate data
with minimal gaps. On the rare instances where there are issues with the raw
data received from DERMS, we employ simple data cleaning algorithms such as
forward filling.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>RTU measurements of access reduction update on
change or every 30-mins in absence of change. We also minimise postprocessing
of RTU data (e.g. we do not time average data). Using the raw data allows us to
ascertain event start and end times of curtailment actions exactly and accurately
determine access reductions experienced by our customers.<o:p></o:p></p>
<h2>Assurance Statement<br></h2>
<p>The dataset is generated and updated by a script
which is scheduled to run daily. The script was developed by the DSO Data
Science team in conjunction with the DSO Network Access team, the DSO
Operations team and the UKPN Ops Telecoms team to ensure correct interpretation
of the RTU data streams. The underlying script logic has been cross-referenced
with the developers and maintainers of the DERMS scheme to ensure that the data
reflects how DERMS operates. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The outputs of the script were independently
checked by the DSO Network Access team for accuracy of the curtailment event
timings and access reduction prior to first publication on the Open Data Portal
(ODP). The DSO Operations team conduct an ongoing review of the data as it is
updated daily to verify that the operational expectations are reflected in the
data.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p>The Data Science team have implemented automated
logging which notifies the team of any issues when the script runs. This allows
the Data Science to investigate and debug any errors/warnings as soon as they
happen.<o:p></o:p></p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-gsp-project-status,Grid Supply Point Project Status Breakdown,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Following the submission of evidence to NESO on the 10th of September 2025 of eligible Gate 2 to Whole Queue projects (G2tWQ), UK Power Networks seeks to provide further insight, at the Grid Supply Point (GSP) level, on the progress status of generation projects. These progress status categories are based on the National Energy System Operator's (NESO) queue formation criteria. This allows further visibility at a more granular level, while protecting individual information from projects.</p>

<p>A project can be classed as one of five categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly progressed projects connecting by 2027 or earlier: Projects that have provided evidence they are meeting Protection Clause 2a, and have a firm or non-firm connection date of 2027 or earlier.</li>
<li>Other significantly progressed projects: Projects that have provided evidence they are meeting Protection Clause 2a, with a connection date of 2028 or later.</li>
<li>Other ready projects: Projects that have provided evidence they are meeting the readiness criteria (without any protection clause), via the land or planning route.</li>
<li>Not ready / Gate 1 choice projects: Projects which have not provided any evidence or have opted for a Gate 1 offer.</li>
<li>Outside of scope for Gate 2 to Whole Queue: <span data-teams=""true"">Projects which were not part of an offer or an application to NESO by the 29th of January 2025, following Ofgem’s decision on pause of applications to NESO.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>We follow a strict approach to ensure that, while we want to share as much useful data as possible, we are not providing specific information that can be linked to an individual project. The progress status of each project is obtained from our internal registers, which in turn has been obtained from our interactions with customers, our delivery pipeline and other requests for information. This is in turn grouped by GSPs and technologies, and classified as one of the seven categories used (aligning with NESO’s Gate 2 Readiness Criteria).</p>

<p>From this dataset, we will apply two iterations to be certain no specific project is identifiable with a progress status stage. In the first place, all categories where the customer count is 1 (e.g. one solar project is Under Construction”) would be blanked out. By doing this, we avoid what we understand would allow that specific project to be identified, by looking at its capacity, and locating it in the queue of that GSP.</p> 

<p>In addition, if, after applying that initial check, there is a technology row with only a single non-blank, non-zero entry, we would blank the entire row . E.g. only three solar projects with Land rights only, those three projects could then be located in the queue as the only three solar schemes. The same blanking out correction is applied if the only non-blank, non-zero row entries are “Projects without readiness or not progress at all” and/or “Outside of scope for Gate 2 to Whole Queue”.</p>

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>This dataset has been peer reviewed, and sample checked.</p>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>
<p>The data provided above constitutes UK Power Networks’ provisional view of the status at this GSP at the date of publication and is for general information only.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-standard-technology-profiles-generation,Standard Profiles UK Power Networks Uses for Electricity Generation,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The dataset captures yearly generation profiles for different generation technology types, used by UK Power Networks to run export curtailment assessment studies.  </p>

<p>UK Power Networks has been running curtailment studies since 2014 in the three licence areas and have been using standards technology specific profiles to model the accepted not yet connected generation capacity. </p>

<p>Generation specific profile include the following generation types: solar photovoltaic, wind, battery and non-variable generation.</p>

<p>The profiles have been developed using actual generation data from connected sites within UK Power Networks licence areas falling into each of the generation categories. The output is a yearly profile with half hourly granularity.</p>

<p>The values are expressed as load factors (percentages) i.e., at each half hour the value can range from 0% to 100% of the maximum export capacity.   </p>

<p>The profiles are revised on a regular basis to ensure that they represent as closely as possible the operational behaviour of unconnected sites. The following change have taken place since UK Power Networks has started issuing curtailment reports:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The solar profile was updated in 2019/2020 and capacity factor was increased from 13.2% to 14.2%;</li>
<li>The electricity storage profiles were updated in April 2024. new profiles available:“Storage_export_enhanced” and “Storage_import_enhanced”;</li>
<li>Gas profiles were updated in September 2024 differentiating between small and large gas generators.  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>This section outlines the methodology for generating annual half-hourly demand profiles. 

</p><p>Connected metered generators falling in each of the categories have been used to create the representative profiles. Historical data from each of these connected generation sites are retrieved from UK Power Networks’ Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) and consist of annual half-hourly meter readings. The profiles are averages of power/capacity at every time period i.e.:</p>

 <p>P<sub>average,t</sub> = average(P<sub>1,t</sub>c<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2,t</sub>c<sub>2</sub> + … + P<sub>n,t</sub>c<sub>n</sub>)</p>

<br>
<br>
where
<ul>
<li>t is time, 30 minutes resolution for one year;</li>
<li>P is the export in MW from sites 1, 2, ..., n; and</li>
<li>c is capacity of site 1, 2, ..., n.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there was bad/missing data then <a href=""https://www.pvsyst.com/"">PVSYST</a> and local meteorological data were used. </p>

<h2>Electricity Storage profiles </h2>

<p>For export/generation studies, storage is modelled as constantly exporting with a varying profile throughout the day, whereas for demand/import studies, storage is modelled as constantly importing with a varying import profile throughout the day. This represent a conservative view, which is used due to the unpredictable pattern of Electricity Storage sites </p>

<p>The solar and storage combined profile is calculated as the maximum of the storage and solar profiles during each 30-minute timestamp. </p>

<p>Storage profiles are detailed in our design standard Engineering Design Standard (EDS 08-5010).  </p>

<p>Storage profiles were updated in April 2024 based following a piece of work delivered by Regen to UK Power Networks on the operational behaviour of battery storage, with the purpose to model  reflect battery storage more realistically in curtailment studies . the revised profile are “Storage_export_enhanced” and “Storage_import_enhanced”. Curtailment reports issued prior to 22 April 2024 were produced using the legacy storage profiles (“Storage”).  </p>

<h2>Gas Profiles</h2>
<p>Gas profiles were updated in September 2024 to provide a more representative view on how gas generator operate and to enable more representative curtailment results.  The legacy profile used to model unconnected gas generators until September 2024 was the “non-variable” profiles. From September 2024, unconnected gas generators are modelled using new “Gas_large” and “Gas_small” profile. The two profiles are meant to capture the differences between smaller genset, quickly ramping up from 0 to maximum capacity, and larger gas generators that rather have a more stable behaviour. The profile have been created with the same equation described above, taking a percentile between 95 and 98, rather than the average.  </p>

<p><span>Note: as of 18 April 2024, we have included an additional column showing the utilisation band of the site. The utilisation bands do not indicate contractually committed capacity e.g. capacity on our network may be unused now but expected to be used by a connection in a future year, recent acceptances which will be covered in next year's data.</span></p>

<p><span>There is a site classification as follows:</span></p>

<ul><li>GMT: Ground Mounted Transformer; and</li><li>PMT: Pole Mounted Transformer.</li></ul>

<p>As per the attached triage document, we have redacted sites from this dataset where a transformer serves five or less customers. This is in the interest of protecting customer privacy. Further, we are aware that for a small number of records there are null values, this is primarily for the rare cases where sites have more than one transformer. There is an ongoing review into how this is recorded, which will be reflected in the data once resolved. If you notice any errors, please let us know by feedbacking against the record in the table tab.</p>

and below. An important part of the distribution network is the stepping down
of voltage as it is moved towards the household; this is achieved using
transformers. Transformers have a maximum rating for the utilisation of these
assets based upon protection, overcurrent, switch gear, etc. This dataset
contains the <b>Grid Substation Transformers</b>, also known as Bulk Supply
Points, that typically step-down voltage from 132kV to 33kV (occasionally down
to 66 or more rarely 20-25). These transformers can be viewed on the single
line diagrams in our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/ltds_ndp_landingpage/"">Long-Term
Development Statements (LTDS)</a> and the underlying data is then found in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/?disjunctive.theme&amp;disjunctive.dublin-core.subject&amp;sort=explore.popularity_score&amp;refine.dublin-core.subject=Long+Term+Development+Statements+(LTDS)"">LTDS tables</a>. <o:p></o:p></p><p>This dataset provides <b>half-hourly current and</b> <b>power
flow</b> data across these named transformers from 2021 through to the previous
month across our license areas. The data are aligned with the same naming
convention as the LTDS for improved interoperability.<o:p></o:p></p><p>Care is taken to protect the private affairs of companies
connected to the 33kV network, resulting in the redaction of certain transformers.
Where redacted, <b>we provide monthly
statistics</b> to continue to add value where possible. Where monthly
statistics exist but half-hourly is absent, this data has been redacted. <o:p></o:p></p><p>To find which transformer you are looking for, use the ‘tx_id’
that can be cross referenced in the <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/ukpn-grid-transformer-operational-data-monthly/information/"" target=""_blank"">Grid Transformers Monthly Dataset</a>, which describes by month what
transformers were triaged, if they could be made public, and what the monthly
statistics are of that site. <o:p></o:p></p><p>If you want to download all this data, it is perhaps more
convenient from our public sharepoint: <o:p></o:p><a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.sharepoint.com/sites/OpenDataPortalLibrary/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?ga=1&amp;id=%2Fsites%2FOpenDataPortalLibrary%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FOperational%20Data%2FGrid%20Transformers&amp;viewid=2e8ce4fd%2D616b%2D4a28%2Dbf3c%2Dfd030122b846"">Open Data Portal Library - Grid Transformers - All Documents (sharepoint.com)</a></p><p>This dataset is part of a larger endeavour to share more
operational data on UK Power Networks assets. Please visit our <a href=""https://ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com/pages/nodd/"">Network Operational

network stored in our historian.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The measurement devices are taken from current transformers
attached to the cable at the circuit breaker, and power is derived combining
this with the data from voltage transformers physically attached to the busbar.
The historian stores datasets based on a report-by-exception process, such that
a certain deviation from the present value must be reached before logging a
point measurement to the historian. We extract the data following a 30-min time
weighted averaging method to get half-hourly values. Where there are no
measurements logged in the period, the data provided is blank; due to the
report-by-exception process, it may be appropriate to forward fill this data
for shorter gaps.<o:p></o:p></p><p>We developed a data redactions process to protect the
privacy or companies according to the <a href=""https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/27/section/105"">Utilities Act
2000 section 105.1.b</a>, which requires UK Power Networks to not disclose
information relating to the affairs of a business. For this reason, where the
demand of a private customer is derivable from our data and that data is not
already public information (e.g., data provided via Elexon on the Balancing
Mechanism), we redact the half-hourly time series, and provide only the monthly
averages. This redaction process considers the correlation of all the data, of
only corresponding periods where the customer is active, the first order
difference of all the data, and the first order difference of only
corresponding periods where the customer is active. Should any of these four
tests have a high linear correlation, the data is deemed redacted. This process
is not simply applied to only the circuit of the customer, but of the
surrounding circuits that would also reveal the signal of that customer.<o:p></o:p></p><p>The directionality of the data is not consistent within this
dataset. Where directionality was ascertainable, we arrange the power data in
the direction of the LTDS ""from node"" to the LTDS ""to
node"". Measurements of current do not indicate directionality and are
instead positive regardless of direction. In some circumstances, the polarity
can be negative, and depends on the data commissioner's decision on what the
operators in the control room might find most helpful in ensuring reliable and
secure network operation.</p><h2 class="""">Quality Control Statement</h2><p>The data is provided ""as is"". <o:p></o:p></p><p>In the design and delivery process adopted by the DSO,
customer feedback and guidance is considered at each phase of the project. One
of the earliest steers was that raw data was preferable. This means that we do
not perform prior quality control screening to our raw network data. The result
of this decision is that network rearrangements and other periods of non-intact
running of the network are present throughout the dataset, which has the
potential to misconstrue the true utilisation of the network, which is
determined regulatorily by considering only by in-tact running arrangements.
Therefore, taking the maximum or minimum of these transformers are not a
reliable method of correctly ascertaining the true utilisation. This does have
the intended added benefit of giving a realistic view of how the network was
operated. The critical feedback was that our customers have a desire to
understand what would have been the impact to them under real operational
conditions. As such, this dataset offers unique insight into that.</p><h2 class="""">Assurance Statement</h2><p>Creating this dataset involved a lot of human data
imputation. At UK Power Networks, we have differing software to run the network
operationally (ADMS) and to plan and study the network (PowerFactory). The
measurement devices are intended to primarily inform the network operators of
the real time condition of the network, and importantly, the network drawings
visible in the LTDS are a planning approach, which differs to the operational.
To compile this dataset, we made the union between the two modes of operating
manually. A team of data scientists, data engineers, and power system engineers
manually identified the LTDS transformer from the single line diagram,
identified the line name from LTDS Table 2a/b, then identified the same transformer
in ADMS to identify the measurement data tags. This was then manually inputted
to a spreadsheet. Any influential customers to that circuit were noted using
ADMS and the single line diagrams. From there, a python code is used to perform
the triage and compilation of the datasets. <o:p></o:p></p><p>There is potential for human error during the manual data

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-curtailment-events-site-specific,Curtailment Events Site Specific,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>When a generation customer requests a firm connection under a congested part of our network, there may be a requirement to reinforce the network to accommodate the connection. The reinforcement works take time to complete which increases the lead time to connect for the customer. Furthermore, the customer may need to contribute to the cost of the reinforcement works.</p>
    <p>UK Power Networks offers curtailable-connections as an alternative solution for our customers. It allows customers to connect to the distribution network as soon as possible rather than waiting, and potentially paying, for network reinforcement. This is possible because under a curtailable connection, the customer agrees that their access to the network can be controlled when congestion is high. These fast-tracked curtailable-connections can transition to firm connections once the reinforcement activity has taken place. Curtailable connections have enabled faster and cheaper connection of renewable energy generation to the distribution network owned and operated by UK Power Networks.</p>
    <p>The Distribution System Operator (DSO) team has developed the Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) that monitors curtailable-connection generators as well as associated constraints on the network. When a constraint reaches a critical threshold, an export access reduction signal may be sent to generators associated with that constraint so that the network can be kept safe, secure, and reliable.</p>
    <p>This dataset contains a record of curtailment events and the associated access reduction experienced by DERs with curtailable connections. Access reduction is calculated as the MW access reduction from maximum × duration of access reduction in hours (MW×h). The dataset categorises curtailment actions into two categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Constraint-driven curtailment: when a constraint is breached, we aggregate the access reduction of all customers associated with that constraint. A constraint breach occurs when the network load exceeds the safe limit; and</li>
        <li>Non-constraint driven curtailment: this covers all curtailment which is not directly related to a constraint breach on the network. It includes customer comms failures, non-compliance trips (where the customer has not complied with a curtailment instruction), planned outages, and unplanned outages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each row in the dataset is a curtailment event, meaning a continuous period of access reduction, with associated start and end times, volume of access reduction, estimated energy reduction, and likely curtailment driver. We also provide the associated grid supply point (GSP) and nominal voltage to provide greater aggregation capabilities.</p>
    <p>Energy reduction has been estimated using a recent history baseline. Future enhancements will look at using more sophisticated baseline estimation methodologies.</p>
    <p>The curtailment driver column represents UK Power Networks' best view of the likely driver of the curtailment. Future improvements may remap drivers and provide a more detailed breakdown of drivers.</p>
    <p>By virtue of being able to track curtailment across our network in granular detail, we have managed to significantly reduce curtailment of our curtailable-connections customers.</p>

    <h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) is installed at each curtailable-connection site providing live telemetry data into the DERMS. It measures communications status, generator output, and mode of operation.</li>
        <li>RTUs are also installed at constraint locations (physical parts of the network, e.g., transformers, cables which may become overloaded under certain conditions). These are identified through planning power load studies. These RTUs monitor current at the constraint and communications status.</li>
        <li>The DERMS design integrates network topology information. This maps constraints to associated curtailable connections under different network running conditions, including the sensitivity of the constraints to each curtailable connection. In general, a 1MW reduction in generation of a customer will cause &lt;1MW reduction at the constraint. Each constraint is registered to a GSP.</li>
        <li>DERMS monitors constraints against the associated breach limit. When a constraint limit is breached, DERMS calculates the amount of access reduction required from curtailable connections linked to the constraint to alleviate the breach. This calculation factors in the real-time level of generation of each customer and the sensitivity of the constraint to each generator.</li>
        <li>Access reduction is issued to each curtailable-connection via the RTU until the constraint limit breach is mitigated.</li>
        <li>Multiple constraints can apply to a curtailable-connection and constraint breaches can occur simultaneously.</li>
        <li>Where multiple constraint breaches act upon a single curtailable-connection, we apportion the access reduction of that connection to the constraint breaches depending on the relative magnitude of the breaches.</li>
        <li>Where customer curtailment occurs without any associated constraint breach, we categorise the curtailment as non-constraint driven.</li>
        <li>Future developments will include the reason for non-constraint driven curtailment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
    <p>The dataset is derived from data recorded by RTUs located at customer sites and constraint locations across our network. UKPN’s Ops Telecoms team monitors and maintains these RTUs to ensure they are providing accurate customer/network data. An alarms system notifies the team of communications failures which are attended to by our engineers as quickly as possible. RTUs can store telemetry data for prolonged periods during communications outages and then transmit data once communications are reinstated. These measures ensure we have a continuous stream of accurate data with minimal gaps. On the rare instances where there are issues with the raw data received from DERMS, we employ simple data cleaning algorithms such as forward filling.</p>
    <p>RTU measurements of access reduction update on change or every 30 minutes in the absence of change. We also minimise post-processing of RTU data (e.g., we do not time average data). Using the raw data allows us to ascertain event start and end times of curtailment actions exactly and accurately determine access reductions experienced by our customers.</p>

    <h2>Assurance Statement</h2>
    <p>The dataset is generated and updated by a script which is scheduled to run daily. The script was developed by the DSO Data Science team in conjunction with the DSO Network Access team, the DSO Operations team, and the UKPN Ops Telecoms team to ensure correct interpretation of the RTU data streams. The underlying script logic has been cross-referenced with the developers and maintainers of the DERMS scheme to ensure that the data reflects how DERMS operates.</p>
    <p>The outputs of the script were independently checked by the DSO Network Access team for accuracy of the curtailment event timings and access reduction prior to first publication on the Open Data Portal (ODP). The DSO Operations team conducts an ongoing review of the data as it is updated daily to verify that the operational expectations are reflected in the data.</p>
    <p>The Data Science team has implemented automated logging which notifies the team of any issues when the script runs. This allows the Data Science team to investigate and debug any errors/warnings as soon as they happen.</p>

ukpowernetworks.opendatasoft.com,UKPN,ukpn-super-grid-transformer-header,Super Grid Transformer Power Flow Header,"<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Daily Demand Statistics (Minimum, Average, Maximum) for Grid Supply Point (GSP).</p>
<p>It includes aggregated GSP Data for all the monitored GSPs, and it also includes SGT data if we have used those for the creation of aggregated data.</p>
<p>Data includes Voltages, Current, Active Power, and Reactive Power, and is updated every half an hour.</p>
<p>This dataset shows data from a sample of GSPs which account for 1/5th of the total GSPs in our area (we will add more sites across the network in the future).</p>
<p>To streamline and enable faster data refresh, we have structured our data into a <i>header</i> file which is light.</p>
<p>This data is refreshed every 30 minutes.</p>

<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>
<p>The power flow data is streamed from our PI server, into an FTP server before being published on the Open Data Portal. To streamline and enable faster data refresh, we have structured our data into a <i>header</i> file which is light.</p>

<h2>Quality Control Statement</h2>
<p>The data is published as is from the network.</p>

<h2>Assurance Statement</h2>
<p>The Open Data Team and DSO Data Science Team worked together to ensure data accuracy and consistency.</p>
