Terminology Standards Applied:

1. Single Imbalance Price (SIP)
   - Replaces ambiguous "System Price"
   - Clarifies that SSP = SBP since P305 (Nov 2015)
   
2. BM Acceptance Rate
   - More accurate than "Dispatch Rate"
   - Measures % of periods with balancing actions
   
3. Explicit Units
   - All percentages marked with (%)
   - All monetary values marked with (£M) or (£)
   
4. Trader-Focused Language
   - "Volume-Weighted Avg" instead of generic "BM Price"
   - "Peak Price Today" instead of "Range (High)"
