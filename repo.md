- 🔋 UK ENERGY SYSTEM DASHBOARD
- 📅 Last Updated: 16 September 2025 at 17:11 | Automated Energy Intelligence Engine
This dashboard is powered by a sophisticated data pipeline that continuously processes the UK's energy landscape. Here's a glimpse of the engine at work:
Massive Data Lake: Tapping into a BigQuery data warehouse containing over 750,000 records and 150MB of granular energy data, including real-time generation, demand, and frequency metrics. Advanced Financial Insights: The system is engineered to integrate complex financial data, including DNO (Distribution Network Operator) mapping and DNUoS (Distribution Network Use of System) charges, providing a multi-dimensional view of energy costs and distribution. Intelligent Automation: A Python-based automation core orchestrates the entire workflow. It dynamically queries the data lake, performs complex calculations, and refreshes this dashboard in near real-time, ensuring you always have the most current and actionable intelligence at your fingertips.
