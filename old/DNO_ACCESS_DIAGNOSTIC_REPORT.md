Generated: 2025-09-11 12:42:33

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Current Status**: ❌ **All primary DNO portals are currently inaccessible**

- **UKPN**: 403 Forbidden on all dataset exports
- **NGED**: API token required (resolvable)
- **SPEN/NPg/ENWL**: 403 Forbidden (OpenDataSoft policy change)
- **SSEN**: 404 Not Found on direct CSV links

## 📊 Detailed Findings

### 1. UKPN (UK Power Networks)
**Issue**: 403 Forbidden on dataset exports
**Root Cause**: OpenDataSoft portal requires authentication or has restricted access

**Affected Datasets**:
- LTDS (Long Term Development Statement)
- Network Capacity Data
- Power Cut History
- Primary Transformer Data
- Circuit Operational Data

**Solutions**:
- Register for OpenDataSoft account on UKPN portal
- Request API key from UKPN data team
- Use alternative CSV download links if available

### 2. NGED (National Grid Electricity Distribution)
**Issue**: API token required for data downloads
**API Status**: ✅ Working

**Registration Process**:
1. Visit https://connecteddata.nationalgrid.co.uk/user/register
2. Create free account with email verification
3. Login and go to account settings
4. Generate API token
5. Use token in Authorization header

### 3. Other DNOs (SPEN, NPg, ENWL)
**Issue**: Systematic 403 Forbidden across all OpenDataSoft portals

**Contact Details**:
- **SPEN**: data.enquiries@spenergynetworks.co.uk
- **NPg**: enquiries@northernpowergrid.com
- **ENWL**: data@enwl.co.uk
- **UKPN**: data@ukpowernetworks.co.uk

## 🚀 Immediate Action Plan

### Priority 1: Get NGED Access (Easiest Win)
1. Register at connecteddata.nationalgrid.co.uk
2. Obtain free API token
3. Run enhanced DNO collector with token

### Priority 2: Contact DNO Data Teams
Email template to send to each DNO:

```
Subject: Request for Energy Data Access - Research Project

Dear Data Team,

I am working on a comprehensive UK energy market analysis project that combines BMRS transmission data with DNO distribution data.

Current Challenge:
- UKPN OpenDataSoft portal returns 403 Forbidden on dataset exports
- Other OpenDataSoft portals (SPEN, NPg, ENWL) show similar restrictions

Request:
1. Current procedure for accessing your open data
2. API keys or authentication requirements
3. Alternative download methods for datasets

Datasets of Interest:
- Network capacity and headroom data
- Long Term Development Statement (LTDS) data
- Flexibility service procurement data
- Historical power flow data

Technical Context:
I have a working BigQuery pipeline processing 53 BMRS datasets (2.7+ years, 300GB+) and need distribution-level data to complete the analysis.

Best regards,
[Your name and project details]
```

### Priority 3: Alternative Data Sources
- **Ofgem**: Regulatory returns contain network data
- **ENA**: Industry aggregated statistics
- **National Grid ESO**: Some distribution-aggregated data
- **Academic partnerships**: Universities may have DNO data access

## 🔧 Technical Solutions

### Enhanced Authentication
The tools can be updated to support:
- Session-based authentication
- API key headers
- OAuth flows
- Browser automation for cookie-based access

### Data Preprocessing
When data becomes available:
- Standardized schema mapping
- Temporal alignment with BMRS data
- Geographic coordinate matching
- Quality validation and cleaning

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today): Register for NGED API token
2. **Short-term** (This week): Contact all DNO data teams
3. **Medium-term** (2-4 weeks): Explore alternative sources
4. **Long-term**: Develop relationships with DNO data teams

The BMRS data you have is already incredibly comprehensive. DNO data would add the "last mile" detail, but your transmission-level analysis provides 80% of the energy market insights needed.
