## Notes on National Grid Electricity Distribution

As mentioned, National Grid acquired Western Power Distribution in 2021 and officially rebranded the company to National Grid Electricity Distribution in September 2022. The four areas were previously known as:

1. Western Power Distribution (East Midlands) - MPAN 11
2. Western Power Distribution (West Midlands) - MPAN 14
3. Western Power Distribution (South Wales) - MPAN 21
4. Western Power Distribution (South West) - MPAN 22

When searching for historical data before 2022, it may be necessary to use the old "Western Power Distribution" name.

## Next Steps for Complete Collection

1. Download all the Excel files for "Schedule of Charges and Other Tables" from each DNO
2. Process files using the existing duos_tariff_extractor.py script
3. Update the MPAN mappings to ensure correct regional identification
4. Integrate with the existing data collection for complete UK coverage
