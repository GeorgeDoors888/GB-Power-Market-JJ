CONCLUSION
----------

We have successfully collected and processed DUoS charging data for 50% of UK DNOs,
covering approximately 50% of UK electricity customers with decade-long historical
data (2017-2026). The data quality is high with official regulatory Excel files
providing comprehensive tariff structures.

The remaining 50% has been identified with confirmed official sources, requiring
automated extraction to achieve 100% UK coverage. This would create the most
comprehensive UK electricity distribution cost dataset available.

Files Generated: 51 extracted tariff sheets from 19 Excel files
Storage: Local directories (duos_extracted_data/, duos_expanded_data/, duos_spm_data/)
Format: CSV files with JSON extraction metadata
Usage: Ready for BigQuery upload and analysis
