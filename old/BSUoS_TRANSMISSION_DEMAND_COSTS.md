## 🔌 **Who Pays BSUoS?**

### **Transmission Connected Demand Customers:**
- Large industrial customers (typically >100MW)
- Major data centers
- Steel works and aluminum smelters
- Large chemical plants
- Distribution Network Operators (DNOs)
- Major retail/commercial complexes

### **Exemptions:**
- Generators (receive negative BSUoS - payments)
- Embedded generation <100MW
- Some storage facilities (depending on configuration)

## 💡 **Key Business Implications**

### **For Large Industrial Users:**
1. **Significant Cost Component:** BSUoS can represent 10-15% of total electricity costs
2. **Predictable:** Fixed tariffs provide 6-month cost certainty
3. **Non-avoidable:** Cannot be reduced through efficiency measures
4. **Hedgeable:** Forward BSUoS contracts available for risk management

### **Cost Management Strategies:**
- **Fixed Tariff Planning:** Budget based on published 6-month tariffs
- **Forward Contracting:** Hedge BSUoS exposure through financial markets
- **Demand Timing:** Consider BSUoS in load scheduling decisions
- **Technology Investment:** Battery storage can optimize BSUoS exposure

## 📋 **Regulatory Framework**

- **Set by:** Ofgem (Office of Gas and Electricity Markets)
- **Frequency:** Updated every 6 months (April and October)
- **Consultation:** Draft tariffs published for consultation before finalization
- **Recovery:** Costs recovered from all transmission-connected demand
- **Methodology:** Based on forecast balancing service costs

## 🎯 **Summary for Transmission Connected Demand**

✅ **Current Situation:**
- BSUoS tariff: £11.03/MWh (forecast for Oct 2026 - Mar 2027)
- Major cost driver for large electricity users
- Constraint management is largest cost component (70.5%)

✅ **Financial Impact Examples:**
- 1 GWh demand = £11,030 annual BSUoS cost
- Large industrial customer (1 TWh/year) = £11 million annual cost
- Represents significant operational expense requiring active management

✅ **Business Planning:**
- Use published fixed tariffs for accurate cost forecasting
- Consider forward hedging for large exposures
- Factor BSUoS into electricity procurement strategies
- Monitor Ofgem consultations for future tariff changes
