# 2. KEY FINDINGS FROM ANALYSIS

## Time Period Patterns:
- RED bands typically occur during weekday peak hours (16:00-19:00)
- AMBER bands typically cover business hours and early evening (07:00-16:00 and 19:00-22:00)
- GREEN bands cover overnight hours (23:00-07:00) and most weekend hours

## Rate Analysis from SSEN Files:
- RED band rates: Range from -8.40 to 32.20 p/kWh (avg ~4.0 p/kWh)
- AMBER band rates: Range from -2.93 to 8.97 p/kWh (avg ~1.0 p/kWh)
- GREEN band rates: Range from -0.63 to 6.85 p/kWh (avg ~0.3 p/kWh)

## Comprehensive Data (including manual table input):
- RED band rates across all DNOs: 10.98 to 13.99 p/kWh (avg: 11.94 p/kWh)
- AMBER band rates across all DNOs: 0.93 to 1.10 p/kWh (avg: 1.01 p/kWh)
- GREEN band rates across all DNOs: 0.16 to 0.25 p/kWh (avg: 0.19 p/kWh)

## Price Differentials:
- RED is 11.8x more expensive than AMBER
- AMBER is 5.3x more expensive than GREEN
- RED is 62.9x more expensive than GREEN

## Regional Variations:
- UK Power Networks has lowest RED band rates (10.98 p/kWh)
- National Grid East Midlands has highest RED band rate (13.99 p/kWh)
- SSEN regions have higher GREEN band rates compared to other DNOs
- London uniquely has two RED bands (11:00-14:00 and 16:00-19:00)

# 3. TECHNICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS TODAY

# 4. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES ADDRESSED

## Data Extraction Challenges:
- SP Manweb files had inconsistent formatting that hindered rate extraction
- Time period definitions were often buried in non-standard locations in Excel files
- Some files had missing or incomplete data
- Excel header parsing issues required workarounds

## Script Improvements:
- Fixed visualization error related to year data type handling
- Enhanced pattern recognition for time period extraction
- Added comprehensive reporting capabilities
- Implemented combined analysis from multiple data sources

# 5. GAPS AND FUTURE WORK

## Data Gaps:
- Missing rate data for SP Manweb despite having the files
- Missing data for 4 DNOs: National Grid (West Midlands), Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire), and both SP Energy Networks regions
- Limited year coverage for some DNOs (particularly SSEN)

## Suggested Next Steps:
1. Develop specialized parser for SP Manweb rate sheets
2. Collect data for missing DNOs
3. Expand year coverage for comprehensive trend analysis
4. Create day profile visualization showing band hours across 24-hour period
5. Implement load shifting calculator to quantify potential savings
6. Analyze historical trends in band definitions and rates

# 6. SUMMARY STATISTICS
