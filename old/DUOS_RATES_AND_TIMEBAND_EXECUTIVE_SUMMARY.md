# DUoS Time Band Analysis: Executive Summary

## Overview

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of Distribution Use of System (DUoS) charging structures across all 14 Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) in the UK. By combining our previously extracted data with the complete table of DNO rates and time bands, we now have a complete picture of how DUoS charges vary by time of day, day of week, and region.

## Key Findings

1. **Red Band Rates** - Peak Pricing (avg: 11.94 p/kWh)
   - Most expensive period, typically 16:00-19:00 on weekdays
   - Highest: National Grid East Midlands (13.99 p/kWh)
   - Lowest: UK Power Networks (10.98 p/kWh)
   - London uniquely has two Red bands (11:00-14:00 and 16:00-19:00)

2. **Amber Band Rates** - Shoulder Pricing (avg: 1.01 p/kWh)
   - Intermediate pricing period, typically business hours and early evening
   - Weekday coverage: Typically 07:00-16:00 and 19:00-22:00
   - Weekend coverage: Varies significantly by DNO
   - Most expensive: SSEN Southern (1.10 p/kWh)

3. **Green Band Rates** - Off-Peak Pricing (avg: 0.19 p/kWh)
   - Lowest cost period, typically overnight and weekends
   - Weekday coverage: Usually 22:00/23:00-07:00
   - Weekend coverage: Most DNOs offer extensive Green periods
   - Highest Green rates: SSEN (0.24-0.25 p/kWh)
   - Lowest Green rates: UK Power Networks (0.16 p/kWh)

4. **Price Ratios**
   - RED is 11.8x more expensive than AMBER
   - AMBER is 5.3x more expensive than GREEN
   - RED is 62.9x more expensive than GREEN

5. **Standing and Capacity Charges**
   - Standing charges range from 59.45 p/day (UK Power Networks London) to 67.10 p/day (SSEN Hydro)
   - Capacity charges range from 21.90 p/kVA/day (UK Power Networks East) to 24.20 p/kVA/day (UK Power Networks London)

6. **Regional Patterns**
   - Scottish DNOs (SSEN Hydro, SEPD) have higher rates across all bands
   - UK Power Networks has consistently lower Red band rates
   - London has unique dual Red band periods
   - Some DNOs have Amber bands on weekends, while others are entirely Green

## Operational Recommendations

1. **Load Shifting Opportunities**
   - Maximum savings potential: Shift consumption from Red to Green periods (average 11.75 p/kWh difference)
   - Medium savings potential: Shift from Red to Amber (average 10.93 p/kWh difference)
   - Modest savings potential: Shift from Amber to Green (average 0.82 p/kWh difference)

2. **DNO-Specific Strategies**
   - London users: Be aware of midday Red band (11:00-14:00) unique to this region
   - SSEN users: More expensive Green rates mean less dramatic savings from load shifting
   - UK Power Networks users: Largest Red-to-Green differential presents best load shifting economics
   - National Grid East Midlands: Highest Red rates make peak avoidance most beneficial

3. **Temporal Considerations**
   - Weekends: Almost all DNOs offer Green rates for majority of weekend hours
   - Overnight: All DNOs offer Green rates during overnight hours (typically 23:00-07:00)
   - Mid-day: Most expensive during 16:00-19:00 across all regions

## Data Visualization

The comprehensive analysis includes visualizations showing:
1. DUoS rates by DNO and band
2. Standing and capacity charges by DNO
3. Time band distribution across weekdays and weekends

This information enables more effective energy management strategies and cost optimization across all UK regions.
